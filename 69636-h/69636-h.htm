  <h2 class='c006'>I.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Salome Shepard gazed wonderingly at the
crowd of people in the street, as she guided
her pony-phaeton through the factory precincts.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What can be the matter with these people?”
she thought. “I’m sure they ought to have
gone to their work before this.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a wet October day. The narrow
street was slippery with the muddy water that
oozed along to the gutters. The factory
boardinghouses loomed up on either side,
dingy and desolate. Even the mills looked
larger and coarser, in the gloomy air of the
morning.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>As she drove by them, the fair owner listened
in vain for the rumble of machinery. Inside,
the great, well-lighted rooms looked dreary
and barn-like in the gray mist that struggled
through the windows.</p>

<p class='c008'>One hour before, the machinery, shrieking
and groaning, had voiced the protest of the
“hands” against their fancied and their real
wrongs. One hour before, every employe had
been in his or her place. But the gloom of the
atmosphere could not obscure the suppressed
excitement of the morning. Shortsighted and
blind to their best interest, they might have
been; but there was not a man among them
who did not feel a tremendous underlying
principle at stake.</p>

<p class='c008'>And so, at precisely ten o’clock, the machinery
had suddenly and mysteriously stopped, and
every man, woman and child, without a word,
had left the mills.</p>

<p class='c008'>All this had happened while Salome Shepard
was calling on an elderly friend of her mother’s
at the other end of the town. It had been a
delightfully cosy morning in spite of the rain;
and, after a gossipy fashion, they had passed
it in discussing, as women will, the newest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>pattern of crochet, the last society-novel, the
coming concerts in town.</p>

<p class='c008'>Salome’s mood was the comfortable one conduced
by such soothing intellectual food, as
she set forth on her homeward drive. The
rain had ceased, and only along the river did
the mists hover, suggesting to her idle fancy
the thick smoke which hangs over a smouldering
fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the fire which had been creeping under
the life of the Shawsheen Mills had but just
burst into flames, which mounted higher and
higher as the day wore on.</p>

<p class='c008'>All through the factory precincts the unwonted
excitement was manifest. Groups of
employes were everywhere—on the street-corners,
in front of tenements and boardinghouses,
in the middle of the street;—and all
were engaged in absorbing discussion of one
exciting theme—the strike.</p>

<p class='c008'>Men without coats or hats; women with
shawls thrown loosely over their heads; girls,
bonnetless and neglectful of dress; unkempt
old women, who were perhaps the home-makers
for these hard-worked and ill-paid people; all
were indifferent save to one subject.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>Even the quick passage, through their midst,
of the pony-phaeton and its mistress failed to
attract attention beyond an occasional surly
glance from the men or an envious one from the
women. Unmindful of the long days in store,
when there would be ample time to discuss
their wrongs, they remained huddled in excited
groups in the wet October air, talking over
the strike,—the famous strike of the Shawsheen
Mills.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I declare!” muttered the young woman
who was hurrying the pony out of these disagreeable
surroundings; “it must be a strike!
Nothing else would crowd them into the street
so. I wonder what they want? Dear me!
what nuisances these work-people are. Why
can’t they be sensible, and when they are earning
a living, be content? Dear me! if I had
the making over of this world I would make
everybody comfortably off, and nobody rich—unless
it were myself,” she added, laughing;
for absolute truthfulness was a necessity of
Salome Shepard’s nature, and she knew perfectly
well that she could not do without the
luxuries to which she had always been accustomed.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>“If I had the making over of the world!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The words repeated themselves in her mind.
If any human being has the power of making
over the world in any smallest degree, something
whispered, that person must be a young,
attractive woman, with a vast property and
absolute control of several hundred people,
besides two millions of dollars in her own right.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dear me!” she said aloud, as she drove
up the graveled road under the dripping yellow
beeches. “How positively dreadful it must be
to be a reformer! How would I look in a
bloomer costume and black bombazine bonnet?
No. Let things alone, keep to your sphere,
young woman,—the proper, well-regulated,
protected and chaperoned sphere of a delicate
young lady, and let the world right its own
wrongs.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She jumped lightly from the phaeton, tossing
the reins to James, and showing her fine, well-turned
figure to excellent advantage as she ran
up the broad steps.</p>

<p class='c008'>The massive doors turned noiselessly at her
approach. She passed through the fine old
hall and went directly up the broad oak staircase
to her room.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>“How comfortable this is,” she said to herself,
as the blazing wood-fire threw flickering
shadows over the dainty hangings, the warm
rugs and the choice pictures.</p>

<p class='c008'>But even as she drew a long sigh of contentment
with her lot, a picture of wet and
muddy streets, thickset with groups of brawny
men and bedraggled, unkempt women, intruded
itself, and the sigh changed its tenor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If I only had the making over of the
world!” she said again aloud; and added resolutely,
“but I haven’t.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>II.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The Shawsheen Mills had been established
many years before the opening of this story
by Salome’s grandfather, Newbern Shepard.
They constituted one of the chief manufacturing
concerns of Shepardtown. They made
more cloth, and that of a better quality, than
any other mill outside the “City of Spindles.”
They employed a much larger force of operatives
than any other factory in the place, and
had always held a controlling interest in town
affairs.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the Shawsheen Mills were first started,
blooming girls from all parts of Massachusetts
came swarming to them, glad of a new and
respectable employment,—came with earnest
purpose to make this new life and its outcomes
subservient to a better future. The conscientious
New England girl of those days took as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>much pride in making a perfect web of cloth
as though it were for her own wearing. Aware
that her employers took an interest in her welfare,
aside from the fact that she was a part of
the motive power of the mill, she rewarded
them with a full performance of her duty. A
mutual goodfellowship had existed, then, between
employer and employed in the years
when old Newbern Shepard was at the head
of his mills.</p>

<p class='c008'>All this had changed. Newbern Shepard
had died after a long and successful career,
leaving the business to his son, Floyd Shepard.
The latter, educated at Harvard, with five years
of study afterward in Germany, had developed
little taste for an active business life such as
his father had led. He had, consequently,
placed the entire business in the hands of Otis
Greenough, a friend of his college-days and a
hard-headed business man. Floyd Shepard
had idled the greater part of his time before
reaching the age of fifty in various parts of
the world.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he came home, married a Baltimore
belle, and passed his old age in his native
place.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>Even then, he gave little thought to the
details of business. He added to and improved
the home of his forefathers, until his
house and grounds were acknowledged to be the
finest in the state. After four years of married
life, his young wife died, leaving him one child—a
babe of three days. Then he retired into
his study, and lived only among his books.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t trouble me with the business,” he
would say to Otis Greenough, on the rare
occasions when it seemed necessary to consult
the owner of the mills. “I care nothing as to
how you manage the works, and know less
how it should be done. Suit yourself as to
details, and keep the mills paying a good profit.
I shall be satisfied.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Upon this principle the mills had been run
for thirty years. The agent and his superintendents
had devoted themselves to the problem
of getting out more goods and making
more money than their competitors, while keeping
the standard of their wares up to its old
mark. They had no time for the problem of
human life involved. The first and principal
question had required a severe struggle, with
active brains and sharp wits. What wonder,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>then, that the increasing mass of operatives
had come to be considered, every year, less as
human beings in need of help and encouragement,
and more as mechanical attachments of
the mills?</p>

<p class='c008'>Only such operatives as had been brought
up in the mills realized the difference. The
employes were mostly of the unwashed population,
expecting nothing but a place to earn
their living and but scanty pay for it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Having, at the outset, no confidence in their
employers, and no feeling of goodwill towards
them, they had no conscientious motive behind
their work. On the contrary, they stood on
the defensive, watching for oppression and
tyranny, and ready to take arms against them.</p>

<p class='c008'>This was the state of things when the first
regularly organized strike occurred at the
Shawsheen Mills.</p>

<p class='c008'>Otis Greenough, although an old man, was
still at the head of the mills. Floyd Shepard’s
death three years before had made no difference
with the vast business interests in his name.
In willing everything he owned to his daughter,
who was already heiress to a large fortune
from her mother’s family, he had provided that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>Otis Greenough should be chief agent during
the remainder of his life; and that the mills
should continue on the same plan by which
they had been run for the past quarter of a
century.</p>

<p class='c008'>Otis Greenough was an arbitrary man, with
that enormous strength of will which a man
must have who is to control and manage two
thousand people and an increasing business.</p>

<p class='c008'>If, in the march of economic progress, he
chose to make changes in the machinery of the
mills, he consulted no one, and cared nothing
for the black looks or surly mutterings of the
operative who might fancy himself injured
thereby. Had it been hinted to him that his
operatives might be trained to take a personal
interest in the success or failure of new experiments
or, indeed, that they had any right to his
brotherly consideration, he would have flouted
the idea.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was his boast that he never wasted words
on the operatives. In short, he was as indifferent
to the rights of Labor as his Lancashire
spinners were to the interests of Capital. Hence
the strike.</p>

<p class='c008'>At noon of the day that Salome Shepard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>had driven through the factory street, Otis
Greenough sat in his private office with his
two superintendents, the treasurer and cashier
of the mills, and one or two subordinates. As
the bell struck for twelve, five men from the
various departments filed in and presented a
written document. They were the committee
appointed by the new Labor Union.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Greenough took the paper with an air
that showed him to be in anything but a
conciliatory mood. Without opening it, he
burst forth angrily:</p>

<p class='c008'>“What, in the name of common sense, is
this farce anyhow? What do you mean by
leaving your work and presuming to come here,
dictating terms to <em>me</em>?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The paper will explain everything, sir,”
replied the foremost of the committee. “We
have our rights—or should have them. The
time has come when we propose to get them.
Will you read the petition, sir?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” thundered the choleric old man. “Not
in your presence. Villard, treat with them.”
Mr. Greenough was too angry to say more.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Villard, the younger superintendent,
stepped forward.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>“I think,” he said, “that you had better
leave us for a time. We shall need to consider
your proposals, whatever they may be.
Go now, and come again later—say at four
o’clock.” Agreeing to this proposition, the
five men turned and left the office. Mr. Villard
sat down again, waiting for the agent to speak.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The confounded whelps!” ejaculated Mr.
Greenough, as soon as he could find breath.
“Open that paper, Villard—the impudent
puppies!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Without answering, John Villard tore open
the envelope, and read the document aloud:</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Whereas</em>, we, the undersigned, believing that our interests
demand an organization which shall promote and protect
affairs relating to us as laboring men; and</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Whereas</em>, we have already organized and maintained such a
society; it is now unanimously agreed that we insist upon the
recognition of such a body by our employers, and upon their
making certain concessions for the benefit of that body.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Whereas</em>, there is a ten-hour system established in this state
by law; we hereby <em>resolve</em> that we will refuse to work ten and
a half or eleven hours a day as has been demanded of us.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Whereas</em>, we believe the introduction of the new frames are
detrimental to the interests of the mule-spinners; we <em>resolve</em>
that they must be taken out, and the old mules replaced, with
a written agreement that no more of the obnoxious machinery
shall be added for, at least, five years.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Whereas</em>, there has been an attempt made to reduce our
wages, especially in the weaving department; we hereby
<em>resolve</em> that we will submit to no curtailment of wages, and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>demand payment of all wages weekly, as is the custom in
certain other mills in this state.</p>

<p class='c009'>Trusting that these our petitions may be granted, our rights
respected, and that harmonious relations will soon be established
between us, we take pleasure in signing ourselves</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Members of the Shawsheen Labor Union</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Before John Villard had finished reading
the paper, Mr. Greenough had risen and was
pacing the floor excitedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shocking!” he exclaimed, as Mr. Villard
folded the paper and returned it to its envelope.
“Preposterous! Do they think they can
impose upon me with such a jumble of unreasoning
nonsense as that? Labor Union, indeed!
Why, the rascals act as if there were
no interests but those of labor. And a beautiful
time they’ve taken to strike—when orders
are pouring in faster than we can possibly keep
up with them. A fine time, indeed!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose,” said John Villard, fearlessly,
“there seems a slight injustice to them, in cutting
down their wages at such a time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What right have they to dictate, I should
like to inquire?” answered the irate agent.
“If they were not a bigoted, unreasoning set,
they’d know they never can serve the interests
of labor in such a way. They’d realize that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>they are only biting off their own noses! They
have probably been worked upon by some
crank of an agitator. If they were not ignorant
dogs, they’d know that they could best
serve the interests of labor by being faithful to
those of capital. Why,” he concluded, his
face growing redder in his wrath, “is this
America? Is this our boasted New England?
Is this a free country? By Jove! I’ve heard
of this sort of thing in England, but in this
republican land, this boasted region of freedom—Great
Scott! What are we coming to?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s this accursed trades-unionism creeping
in among us,” put in the treasurer’s mild voice,
as Otis Greenough paused for breath. “I’ve
been expecting it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Blast it, why didn’t you mention it then?”
returned Mr. Greenough. But the treasurer
retired in confusion behind his books and did
not answer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, Villard,” continued the agent, “I
hope now you will give up the Utopian schemes
you’ve been nursing for the elevation of the
laboring classes. You see just what a foolish,
unthinking, unreliable set of men we have to
deal with.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>“On the contrary, sir,” returned the second
superintendent, firmly, “I sympathize, to a
degree, with them. I agree that they have
taken an inopportune time to enforce their
views, and regret that they could not have seen
fit to keep at work while their petition was
being considered; and I would advise——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want no man’s advice until I ask it,”
interrupted the elder man. “This is our first
strike, and it shall be the last so long as I have
authority here. Humph! They think they
can intimidate me! They have chosen this
time because they think I <em>must</em> yield now.
They little know me. Otis Greenough has not
run the Shawsheen Mills successfully thirty
years, to be brow-beaten and conquered in the
end by a pack of ignorant laborers.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But how is this to end?” asked the first
superintendent, speaking for the first time.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It can end whenever these men will take
back their impudent paper and go to work.
Villard, when they show up again—four o’clock
did you say?—you will tell them so. Offer
them a chance to go to work to-morrow morning
on the old terms. You needn’t give in to them
one inch. Do you hear? Not a jot or tittle.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>“And what if they do not accept?” asked
Villard.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, advertise. Advertise far and near.
Get new help. We’ll open the mills and run
them, too, right in their very teeth. I’ll show
them that he who has been master here for
thirty years is master until he dies.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>III.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The choleric agent’s blood was fairly up,
and he now set himself to plan for the coming
warfare. When the committee from the labor
union made its appearance at four o’clock, the
agent refused to treat directly with them. He
retired to his inner office, whence issued a
moment later an “open letter to the employes
of the Shawsheen Mills.” The circular was
composed and written entirely by himself, and
was quite characteristic of his high-handed
authority. It stated that “as the control of
an owner over his property was guaranteed
by the law of the land, and was of such unquestionable
character as ought not to be
meddled with by any other individual or combination
of individuals, the agent of the Shawsheen
Mills, acting for their owner, would brook
no such interference as had been attempted.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>But, in bombastic language, he went on to say
that, on account of the pressure of work, he
offered to take back into the mills such operatives
as, after a day’s idleness and a night’s
calm reflection, might decide to come back
peacefully, and accept the old conditions. The
circular closed by adding that all returning
operatives must renounce their connection with
the new Labor Union, and stating that the
Shawsheen Mills would be immediately re-opened.</p>

<p class='c008'>This letter, as might have been expected,
only served to fan the smouldering embers of
discord. It was taken at once to the quarters
of the new Union, and angrily discussed. A
stormy meeting was held that evening, and
scores of new members were added to the organization,
all unanimously agreeing, not only to
keep away from the mills themselves, but to
prevent other operatives from entering them.
The trouble which might have been met at the
outset and subdued by candid discussion and a
fair acknowledgment on each side of the claims
of the other, was changed into a barricade of
danger between labor and capital over which
a battle was to be fought, involving money and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>credit and losses on one side, and daily bread
for two thousand people on the other.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come,” said Otis Greenough, emerging from
his “den” after the committee had left the
office. “I want you, Villard, and you, too,
Burnham,” he added, turning to the other
superintendent, “to go with me this evening,
to the owner of these mills, and lay before her
the proceedings of the day, and our reasons for
taking a firm stand. Although, precious little
difference it will make with her, I imagine, how
many strikes we have, until her income is
affected! Will you be so good as to state,
Villard, what you are smiling at.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I was thinking, sir, that it is a queer state
of affairs, when a person owning large and influential
mills like these, need not know of the
strike or be consulted with regard to it, until it
is half over,” answered Villard. He had no
fear of the agent, with whom he was a favorite,
in spite of his seeming harshness. “It seems
to me, if I were a young woman, with unlimited
leisure and wealth, I should care to know
something of so tremendous an interest as the
Shawsheen Mills represent—that is, if I owned
them.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>“Ha, ha!” laughed the agent, “that shows
how much of a ladies’ man you are, John.
Much you know about the things that interest
and amuse the young ladies. By Jove! I
should laugh to see the daughter of Floyd
Shepard meddling with the details of the great
business he left her. She could discuss French
and Italian literature, or the different schools
of music and art, by the hour, and fairly inundate
you with a flood of learning; but when it
comes to mills—why, she don’t know a loom
from a spinning-jenny—and don’t want to.
I’m only going up there as a matter of form.
As for advice, she knows I wouldn’t take it,
even if she has any to offer. But courtesy—proper
courtesy,” and Otis Greenough drew
himself up to his fullest height, “and the respect
we owe her as the owner of this property, demand
that we go there this evening. I will call for
you in my carriage at half-past seven.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And, so saying, he left the office.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I reckon the old man is about right,” said
Burnham, when they were alone. “Miss
Shepard knows no more about the practical
affairs of her mill, than that little white kitten
over there does. She’ll meet us with a listless,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>half-bored air, pretending to listen to the statements
of our chief, and all the time be wishing
us at the antipodes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you know,” interrupted John Villard,
locking the door to the office as they left it
together, “I’ve very little patience with
women of that sort. Think, with her youth
and health and money, what a directing,
reforming force in bringing together the conflicting
interests of labor and capital she might
be! Great Heavens! I wish I had her opportunity.
I’d make something of it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, you are too Utopian,” replied Burnham.
“It is fortunate she isn’t that kind. We
should be overwhelmed with Schemes for the
Amelioration of the Condition of This, That,
and The Other Thing, until there would be
nothing left but bankruptcy for all of us. No.
I want no reformers in petticoats at the head
of the Shawsheen Mills. But here I am at my
street. Good-bye, till evening.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Salome Shepard passed a dull afternoon.
Although a young woman of resources she
found herself in no mood to enjoy any of them
after lunch. The newest volume of essays
seemed insufferably dull, and she turned for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>relief to the latest novel; but, in spite of the
fact that this book was talked about throughout
the country, she soon threw it aside with a
wearied air and sat gazing into the blazing
hickory fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>Strange! but the red-hot coals formed themselves
into a group against the dull back-log
like the groups of miserable, excited men and
women of the morning against a background
of rain and fog and muddy streets. It was an
uncomfortable picture, and she rose suddenly,
and, going into the music-room, seated herself
at the piano. Chopin’s Nocturnes stood open
on the rack, but she tossed them aside and
began some stormy Liszt music, breaking off
when half done and going to the window.</p>

<p class='c008'>The rain had begun to fall again and the
fog had settled like a pall over everything
farther off than the arched gateway. She
wondered if all those people were still standing
in the mud and rain.</p>

<p class='c008'>An elderly lady, with soft white hair and
exquisite laces, came in.</p>

<p class='c008'>Salome ran forward, pushed her aunt’s favorite
chair into the position she liked best, and
put her into it.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>“Why did you stop playing? And why did
you attempt that brilliant thing?” said Mrs.
Soule. “You are so dreadfully out of practice,
you know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It wasn’t that,” answered the younger
woman; “I’m not in the mood for playing anything.
I doubt if I could get through with
‘Bounding Billows’ or the ‘Fifteenth Amusement’
to-day. Did you know, aunty, there
is a strike down at the mills?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A strike! Mercy, who has struck?” responded
the elder in shocked tones.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, the operatives, of course. I don’t
know why, or anything about it. I have never
shown any interest in the mills,” she went on
eagerly and half-apologetically, “but I should
like to know what it is all about—why they did
it—what they want, and all that. I should
think Mr. Greenough would come up here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He will come as soon as he deems it
proper.” Mrs. Soule’s voice was calmness and
precision itself. “It is not nice for young
ladies to mix themselves up in such common
things.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, aunty,” laughed Salome, “strikes are
not common things here. We never had one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>before. And I am not so very young a lady
as to need the same careful guardianship I
had when I was sixteen. I am twenty-seven
years old.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There is no need of saying so upon all
occasions, if you are,” replied her aunt with
some asperity. “A strike, like all things connected
with, or originated by the ignorant laboring
class, is common in the sense of being
vulgar. Any woman, young or old, brought
up as delicately and carefully as you have
been, demeans herself by connection with such
things. You have an agent—a manly and
capable one; leave the settlement of such
things to him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I’m not going to meddle with the strike.
The very suggestion that I would wish to have
anything to do with settling the difficulty
makes me laugh.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Salome rose and began to pace the room.
“But sometimes, lately, aunty, it has occurred
to me that a young woman of average talent,
with a great business on her hands which employs
two thousand people, may have something
to do in life more than to seek her own
selfish enjoyment—a pursuit which, after all,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>is not elevating and leaves but a restless, unsatisfied
spirit in its wake. I came across
some of grandfather’s manuscripts two or three
weeks ago and have been reading them. He
wasn’t like papa. The mills were a part of his
very self. The operatives were almost like so
many children to him. I’ve read in his, and in
other books, about the mill-girls of his day.
Girls whose working days began at daylight in
winter and ended at half-past seven in the
evening; who had only two dresses to their
backs, and those of Merrimack print; whose
profits for a week, after their board was paid,
were only two dollars. But girls who could
discuss Shakespeare, Dante, and Milton at their
looms; who read Locke and Abercrombie and
Pollock and Young (something I can’t do!);
who sent petitions to Congress for the abolition
of slavery; who helped build churches from
their pitiful savings; who wrote essays and
poems and stories, even while running their
looms; who spent their evenings in the study
of German and French and botany; and
who went out, at last, to become teachers and
mothers and missionaries, and, above all, noble,
self-sacrificing, helpful women. And I tell you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>that, with all my money and my polished
education, I envy them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Salome, really, you surprise me,” exclaimed
the excellent lady who was listening to her.
“Calm yourself, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look at the girls in this mill—in my grandfather’s
mill to-day—in my mill,” she went
on. “Beings of bangs and bangles and cheap
jewelry, of low aspirations, and correspondingly
low morals! They are not to blame for
their penny-dreadful lives, because they know
no better. They dream of nothing higher than
their looms and their face-powder, and their
cheap satins and false hair—why should they?
They see rich and educated women like us
wrapped entirely in ourselves, each anxious to
outshine the rest, and all seemingly lost in the
mad race after fashionable attire. They do
not know, poor things, that we ever think or
talk of higher subjects. I tell you, I feel that
I am, somehow, responsible for them. And yet,
I don’t know how to help them. My grandfather
could, but I can’t.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know nothing of such things,” coldly
replied her aunt. “It is not ladylike to fly
into a passion over the fancied wrongs of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>lower order of beings. I beg that you will
recollect that you are the daughter of Cora Le
Bourdillon and Floyd Shepard.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And more than that,” Salome whispered to
herself as she sought the quiet of her own
room, “I am afraid I am the grand-daughter
of Newbern Shepard.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>IV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It was nearly eight o’clock when carriage-wheels
were heard coming up the graveled
drive-way, and Otis Greenough and his associates
were announced.  Salome and her aunt
were sitting in the music-room, and came forward
at once; the former with an unmistakable
air of eagerness.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tell me about the strike, Mr. Greenough,”
she asked, before he had fairly seated himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, then, you’d heard of it, eh?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I saw something of it this morning, driving
through the town.  I could not help knowing
what it was.  But why did they do it?  What
do they want?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They did it,” and Otis Greenough sat up
with a judicial air, “because they are rascally
dogs, and do not know when they are well off.
And they want?—well,—the earth—more pay,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>shorter hours, and the Lord knows what besides.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, and why shouldn’t they have it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The question fell like a bomb upon her surprised
audience.</p>

<p class='c008'>“To be sure, I know very little of these
things, practically, although I have taken the
prescribed doses of social economy in my readings
under Professor Townsend,” she went on;
“but it has occurred to me, within a few days,
that the laboring classes have very little control
over their own lives, and are not much more
than slaves to us who hold the reins of
power.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bless me!” thought Otis Greenough, staring
at her. If his office-door had suddenly
spoken, offering him officious counsel as to
his method of conducting the mills, he could
hardly have been more surprised. “Bless me!
No Floyd Shepard about her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If the operatives are poorly paid, and we
are making more money than ever before (I
think I understood you so the other day?),”
the young woman was saying, “why shouldn’t
their wages be raised? It seems but fair, to
me.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>“Much you know about it, little girl,” Mr.
Greenough found voice to say, addressing her
as he used to in by-gone days, when she occasionally
strayed into the mills and teased to be
taken through them. “Much any young lady
of the world can know of such matters. We
would not have you turn from being your own
charming self, and become a learned blue-stocking,
or bloomered reformer; but there are
many, many reasons which come between the
questions of profit and loss, and the petty details
of operatives’ wages, which cannot be explained
to you here and now. They were contented
enough until some rascal or other, having
become imbued with the spirit of these labor
unions starting up all over the country, must
needs organize one here. By Jove! I’ll employ
detectives and hunt out the disturbing
elements and shut them up. I have offered
every mother’s son a chance to go back to work
to-morrow morning, on condition that he drops
this union business; but I am told to-night
that not one of them will accept. Ignorant
creatures! I’ll show ’em what it means to
fight a rich and strong concern like this, in the
vain hope of bringing us to their terms.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>“Meanwhile,” it was Villard who spoke,
“we are to go on resisting their combined
ignorance and impatience, and perhaps worse
elements, losing thousands of dollars in the
warfare, are we?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, rather than give in one inch to them,”
answered Mr. Greenough. “This is the first
organized strike and must be made a warning
to future disturbers. It’s those confounded
Englishmen trying to transplant their foreign
ideas to American soil. If we give in to them
now, we establish a bad precedent.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I must confess,” said Villard, “that I do
not see it. I have seen several strikes, and
know that generally both sides lose sight of
reason, and determine to fight it out regardless
of cost. I am afraid, with the course you propose
to adopt, sir, that we shall go on until the
losses on our side or the suffering and privation
on theirs will become unbearable; and then
one side or the other will be forced to yield.
If it should be they, a smouldering resentment
will be left, ready to break out anew at
the first convenient season. If we, they
will feel encouraged to try still more arbitrary
measures in the future. Or if a compromise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>be effected, it will be one that might as well be
made to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You talk well for a young man,” admitted
Mr. Greenough. “How did you come by your
exceedingly humane and sympathetic views?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I began as an employe myself,” answered
Villard, “and I know how they feel to some
extent. I know what it is to work at the lowest
drudgery of a mill, and can imagine how it
must seem to have no hope of ever rising to a
higher position. Hard, unremitting toil, long
hours with endless years of hopeless work in
prospect, the lowest possible wages, a large and
rapidly increasing family, with perhaps an aged
parent or invalid wife to support—I tell you
lots of those fellows have all that to bear, knowing
the utter impossibility of ever saving anything,
or of raising their own condition. I say,
sir, looking at life from their standpoint, it’s
mighty hard.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, well,” put in Mr. Greenough, testily,
“a great many of them want nothing better.
They would not know what to do with a better
chance for life, as you call it, if they had it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Simply put yourself in their place, sir,”
said Villard. “What if you were forty years
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>younger than you are, and condemned to a life
of toil at the looms, for instance, would you not
claim the right to combine with others of like
occupation and interests and ask for a better
chance? These men of ours have taken an
unreasonable way of asserting themselves, but
I think they are entitled to our respect, and
should be dealt with as men. An open, fair
discussion of the wage question or the ten-hour
law can result in nothing but good for both
sides.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are young,” Mr. Greenough replied,
“and believe everything in this world can be
made to run exactly as you want it. When
you are older, you’ll realize better the indifference
and general mulishness of the world, and
of operatives in particular. I do not believe in
meeting and deferring to them as equals. They
are not worth our efforts, and so long as they
are under the influence of hot-headed devils
who pose as labor reformers, just so long we
are going to see trouble.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If we were to make a fair compromise with
them,” Mr. Burnham was speaking for the
first time, “and let them see that we, as
humane employers, have a greater desire for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>their interest than any foreigner can have,
wouldn’t it work a reaction in our favor? From
a strictly business point of view, perhaps it
would be money in our pockets.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” urged Villard, “if we were to show
ourselves willing to consider an intimate knowledge
of their needs and thus prove ourselves
their best friends, it would be only a case of
practical philanthropy, and one which would
raise our profits every year, I believe. It is
only the first step that costs, you know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t believe it,” stoutly maintained the
agent. “In my day there has been very little
talk of managers and owners deferring to their
help. I hire my own operatives and reserve the
right to raise, or lower, their wages as I please.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, Mr. Greenough,” broke in Salome
eagerly, “don’t you consider their circumstances
at all? Don’t you, for instance, in a driving
time, pay them any higher wages than in dull
times? I think there would be nothing but
fairness in that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My dear young lady,” was the answer in
patronizing tones, “don’t bother your brains
with such things. You cannot understand
them. Why try?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>“Imagine our Salome posing as a philanthropist
or a social economist,” interrupted Mrs.
Soule’s mellifluous tones. “We had a great
laugh over the idea this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Salome bit her lip and said nothing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think,” continued her aunt in the same
smooth accents, “that we have talked business
long enough. I am sure, Mr. Greenough, that
Salome is, and will be perfectly satisfied with
any course you may see fit to adopt with
regard to the strikers. Women, you know,
ladies at least, have no heads for business, and
we, certainly,” with an indescribable turn of
voice on the “we”—“we, certainly, have had
no training to fit us for reformers. And now
shall we not have some music? Salome, dear,
will you play that delightful little suite of
Moscowzki’s that I like so well?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The young woman rose and, going to the
piano, did as she was bid, although somewhat
mechanically. Then Mr. Greenough
proposed a song from Mr. Burnham, who possessed
a fine baritone voice, and the evening
wore away with music and light conversation.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the three men went home, the elder
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>was in fine spirits, in spite of having been
shocked and discomfited to an unusual degree,
by the unexpected disclosure of views which he
termed “strong-minded” on the part of the
fair owner of the Shawsheen Mills.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If there should come to be hard times and
perhaps destitution among the operatives before
this difficulty is settled,” Salome said to John
Villard as he was preparing to go, “such destitution
as we read of in foreign countries in
times of labor disturbances, I hope you will
let me do something to relieve it. Strange as
it may seem, I have a much better idea of
such a state of affairs there than here—among
my own mills.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There will be no such state of affairs, I
trust,” was his reply, “as is pictured in English
novels.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You have guessed accurately as to the
sources of my information,” she laughed.</p>

<p class='c008'>He smiled too, and continued,</p>

<p class='c008'>“Meanwhile, if we pursue the policy proposed,”
and he glanced at Mr. Greenough, who
was making gallant speeches to Mrs. Soule,
“you might keep a watchful eye on the help.
You could tell, you know, by the women, if they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>came to absolute distress. Of course, there is no
knowing how long this thing may last.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Me! You look to me for such a thing,” and
it was hard to tell whether her tone was amused
or sarcastic only. “Why, Mr. Villard, I do
not know one of the operatives in the mills—not
even by sight. If I were to meet them on
the main thoroughfare to-morrow I should
not know them from other women of their
class.”</p>

<p class='c008'>John Villard raised his eyebrows and turned
to put on his coat without another word. The
situation was incomprehensible to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Salome saw this, and winced under it. She
made no further attempt at conversation, but
said good-night graciously to Mr. Greenough
and the older superintendent, recognizing
Villard’s parting nod at the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There,” said her aunt, as they went back
into the firelight, “I hope they won’t feel it
necessary to come here and consult with us
again so long as the strike is on. As though
you knew or cared anything for it, my dear!
But, of course, they had to come as a matter
of form. Any way, I’m glad it is over. Play
something.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Salome complied, playing the first thing
which came to her mind—the opening bars of
the <cite>Sonata Pathetique</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wish,” she said to herself as she disrobed
for the night, “that I were a capable woman
of affairs—and that John Villard were my
agent.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Not for a week could enough new help be
hired to even make a show of opening the
Shawsheen Mills. Labor Unions were a comparatively
new thing in this country, and were
not so thoroughly organized as now; and a
few of the old operatives, rather than starve,
were glad to go back into the mills on any
condition. But the great majority refused
with indignation to give up their claims, and
proceeded to “make things hot,” as they
expressed it, for the “scabs” and “mudsills.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Work was attempted in the mills, although
many looms stood silent and the spinning-mules
were entirely deserted. Thread for warp was
procured from a neighboring city at no small
expense and the mills were run at a loss, to
prove the agent’s assertion that “he would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>show them who was manager of the Shawsheen
Mills.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This sort of thing was kept up four days.
On the fifth morning, the operatives went as
usual to the mill, but the machinery, after a
few insufficient groans, gave up in despair and
settled into utter quiet.</p>

<p class='c008'>What was the matter?</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a great hurrying to and fro, and
a close examination of belts and machinery.
Word was soon brought up from the basement.
The engines had been tampered with; on each
of them the belts had been cut. The jocularly
inclined said the “engines had joined
the Union;”—while everybody wondered
what effect this stroke would have on the agent.</p>

<p class='c008'>The premises were examined and the night-watchman
questioned. Evidently the deed had
been done by some one familiar with the place,
but there was not the slightest clue. He had
done well his work, and the mills were stopped
for repairs.</p>

<p class='c008'>Otis Greenough blustered about and cursed
the whole business; but he was farther than
ever from a compromise, declaring that he
would yet beat them with their own weapons.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>The night-watch was doubled and the mills
were opened again the next day. But the employers
were fighting a desperate party and little
calculated their strength. The man who had
succeeded so well in his first attempt to stop the
mills risked himself again; and on the second
morning the machinery again refused to start.
This time a small wheel had been removed
from each engine and carried away. The
water-wheel had long been in partial disuse and
could not be trusted without the engines.
Hence, there was nothing to be done but to stop
again for repairs. This time it was a week
before the engines were in running order.
And yet, not a word passed between the agent
and the strikers.</p>

<p class='c008'>The night-watch were discharged and new
ones engaged. A special police was secured to
patrol the mill-yard, and when the mills were
again opened, it was with the avowed determination
to keep them going in spite of every
earthly power.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next morning, notwithstanding the
positive assertions of police and night-watch
that no one had been near the mills, every
band connecting the looms to the machinery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>above was cut in half a dozen places. Then
the superstitious operatives whispered among
themselves that unseen agencies were linked
with the Union, and that the strikers must
succeed in the end; and many of the fainthearted
went over to the new labor party.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is of no use trying to run the mills in this
way,” said Mr. Burnham. “We have already
lost several thousand dollars. We must compromise.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Never,” said Mr. Greenough. “The terms
of Floyd Shepard’s will grant me absolute
power here, and so long as I live, it shall never
be said that an educated, trained and levelheaded
business man was overcome by a lot
of ignorant bullies and agitators. These Labor
Unions all over the State need an example.
There is money enough in the mill treasury to
fight them until they starve themselves out.
No other mill or corporation about here will
hire them, and it is only a matter of weeks
or months when absolute poverty forces them
to yield. Not one inch will I give in to them.
They shall come back as beggars, glad to
accept work at even lower wages than they
have ever had. I’ll teach them a lesson.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>Geoffrey Burnham turned away full of anger
that a flourishing business should be destroyed
by one man’s obstinacy. John Villard went
back to the silent looms, full of righteous
indignation, not only at the total disregard of
practical business interests, but at the want of
humanity and philanthropy and Christian charity,
which by his subordinate position he must
seem to countenance.</p>

<p class='c008'>Weeks lengthened themselves into months,
and still the Shawsheen Mills were closed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Salome Shepard, after spending the holiday
season with friends in New York, came home,
satiated with social success, and a little tired of
the endless pursuit of pleasure. Still the mills
lay idle and Otis Greenough refused to talk any
more with her on the subject of the strike.
And the terms of her father’s will held her
powerless, even had she chosen to exercise her
authority.</p>

<p class='c008'>But she chafed under the knowledge that
two thousand people, who were in a sense dependent
upon her for their daily bread, were
out of work in the midst of a hard winter.</p>

<p class='c008'>One day she went to walk down among the
people who were suffering, now, for a principle.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>She was amazed at the gaunt, hungry look
of the old men; and self-accused at the
pinched and wan faces of the few children who
played in the narrow streets. Unthinking, she
had put on a seal-skin cloak. It was a cold
day, and furs, to her, were only a natural
accompaniment to the frosts of winter.</p>

<p class='c008'>But going down the uncared-for side-walk,
she rebuked herself, noting the single shawl
and calico dress of an old woman who was
wearily making her way a few paces in front
of her. Presently the woman stopped, seized
with a paroxysm of coughing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Salome came up with her, and looked into
the white face, which told of hard times.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Madam,” she said, respectfully, “can I be
of any assistance to you? Shall I not help
you home?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her tone and manner were exactly the same
she would have used to any of her aunt’s
friends. It did not occur to her to be patronizing
or condescending.</p>

<p class='c008'>The old woman stared at her. She was not
used to being addressed as “Madam.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes’m,” she said, presently. “I live up
to the other end of the street. If the cough
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>wasn’t so bad, an’ my side didn’t ketch me
so! But if I can git back to my own chair
ag’in——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Another fit of coughing seized her, and
interrupted the “garrulousness of uncultured
old age.” Salome waited until she got breath
again and then took her by the arm, accommodating
her steps to the feebler ones.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here and there a surprised face peered
curiously at her through a dirty window, knowing
who she was, and wondering that she condescended
to walk with old Granny Lancaster.
Everywhere a general air of poverty, perhaps
of actual hunger, impressed this woman, who
had inherited the tumble-down tenement houses
on each side.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I beg your pardon,” she said, “but do you
eat nourishing food enough? Good beef-steak
and roast-beef would help your cough more
than medicine.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The old woman laughed, a grating, cackling
laugh.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Beef-steak and roast-beef ain’t for the likes
o’ me,” she said. “Meat of any kind ain’t for
us in times o’ strikes. May the Lord above
send us oatmeal enough to keep us through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>till the mills open ag’in is all I ask. Here’s my
house. Much ’bleeged, lady.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Salome wanted to go inside the rickety old
door and follow the woman up the dirty stairway,
but she did not say so, and the old woman
hobbled up the steps without asking her in.</p>

<p class='c008'>Salome felt impulsively in her pocket, and
drawing out her porte-monnaie, emptied its
contents into the dirty, emaciated palm of
Granny Lancaster. Then she turned and
walked rapidly back home.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next day Otis Greenough called on her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My dear,” he said, after an hour or two
passed in desultory conversation, “may I beg
that you will keep away from the operatives?
Impulsive and injudicious charity does them
more harm than anything else. No doubt the
part of Lady Bountiful seems a pleasant and
desirable one, but, just now, you are not fitted
for it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you mean, sir?” asked she in a
puzzled tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“For instance,” he went on, “the money
you gave a certain old woman on the corporation
yesterday was taken by her son-in-law
last night, and furnished him an opportunity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>for a glorious old drunk. I beg your
pardon for using their phraseology. He was
arrested before morning for drunkenness and
disorderly conduct.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do not comprehend,” she stammered.
“The woman said they had no meat. She was
actually suffering for nourishing food. I gave
the money, impulsively it is true, but that
they need not go hungry.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, you see, my dear,” he answered,
“just how much encouragement one gets in
trying to do anything for the laboring classes.
They turn upon you and use the goodness of
your heart and your generous motives to drag
themselves down to a lower depth of degradation.
Good-day, my dear, and don’t be led
away by your feelings.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Salome stood looking after him, heart-sick
and discouraged. The world—her part of it,
at least—was all wrong, and she, with plenty
of money and an awakening desire to help, was
powerless. She ordered the pony phaeton
again and started for a drive. She obeyed a
sudden impulse to go through the factory precincts.
There were evidences of a suppressed
excitement. Knots of desperate-looking men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>stood about. But they hushed their voices as
she drew near, and stood in sullen silence as
she passed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There is evidently something in the wind,”
she thought, urging the pony to quicken his
pace.</p>

<p class='c008'>She did not know that the committee from
the Labor Union had that morning made a
third attempt to treat with her agent and
failed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No compromise,” was still his watchword.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll send for Marion Shaw,” she said to
herself, on her way home an hour later. “She
is a practical, sensible, business-like woman.
Perhaps she will know of some way to help me
to help others. And she needs rest.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This idea so inspired her that she arrived
home quite elated, and stated her plan to Mrs.
Soule at dinner-time with much animation.</p>

<p class='c008'>But later in the evening, the groups of men
she had seen on “the corporation” came back
to her mind and caused her a certain feeling of
uneasiness. What had they been talking about
so excitedly as she drew near?</p>

<p class='c008'>It was one of those suddenly warm nights
in January that succeed, in our fickle climate,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>a bitter cold day, and Salome felt an unaccountable
desire to be in the open air. She threw
on a warm wrap and hood, and saying nothing,
went out on the piazza, and crossed the lawn
to a favorite walk of hers in summer—a path
under a long group of fir-trees down by the
street at the back of the house.</p>

<p class='c008'>After a few turns, she heard a peculiar
whistle which was answered by another.</p>

<p class='c008'>She withdrew still more into the shadow and
waited. Presently two men met.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, what’s the news?” eagerly asked
one.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sh—sh! not so loud,” replied the other.
“It’s all right, and better than we expected.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why—how better?” asked the first.</p>

<p class='c008'>They spoke lower, so that Salome could
scarcely catch the tones.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because,” the first was saying, “the old
man himself has gone down to the mill.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Whe—e—w!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes. What on earth possessed him? But
then that’s none of our affairs. If he wants to
run the risk of losing his life—that’s his
business, not mine.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, but,” and the first voice had a timid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>note, “that’s going too far—we were only to
blow up the mill—not to kill anybody.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can’t help that. Fifteen minutes more,
if everything works well, and old man Greenough’s
day is over. Jim’s just about lighting
the fuse, I reckon, now. It’s an awful
long one, but the fire’ll creep round there in
time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What about the police?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s all right. We’ve fixed him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The voices grew fainter and ceased altogether,
only the dull sound of the men’s footsteps
reaching her as they passed down the hill away
from the grounds.</p>

<p class='c008'>Salome stood an instant, rooted to the spot.
What was this horrible thing she had heard?</p>

<p class='c008'>The factory to be blown up?</p>

<p class='c008'>She must go for help.</p>

<p class='c008'>And Mr. Greenough down there, risking his
life?</p>

<p class='c008'>No. There was no time to get help.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Fifteen minutes more, if everything works
well, and old man Greenough’s day is over.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The whole plot flashed across her bewildered
brain. She dashed through the back-gate and
down the deserted street towards the mills. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>was a ten minutes’ walk across that way, but she
ran,—flew,—tore down the lonely road in less
than half that time.</p>

<p class='c008'>Otis Greenough might be an unreasonable,
hot-headed, obstinate agent, but he was her
father’s friend and had loved and petted her
when she was a motherless child.</p>

<p class='c008'>What could she do? Raise an alarm? Call
for help? Rouse everybody?</p>

<p class='c008'>But the fuse was already lighted.</p>

<p class='c008'>Where was it?</p>

<p class='c008'>Under the office window most likely, since
they knew that the old agent was in there.</p>

<p class='c008'>She came in sight of that window. There
was a dim light there. All else was dark.
The south wind moaned dismally.</p>

<p class='c008'>She hurried faster and came nearer the office
window. Under it was another window with a
broken pane, from which hung something she
instantly divined as the fuse.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yes. A fiery spark crept closer and closer
to the wall.</p>

<p class='c008'>By the time she reached the window it was
out of her reach.</p>

<p class='c008'>Oh, God! could she do nothing?</p>

<p class='c008'>She had been sewing on some dainty trifle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>earlier in the evening, and a pair of small
scissors still hung at her waist.</p>

<p class='c008'>Closer drew the spark of fire to the broken
window pane, whence it would disappear to work
its fearful errand. It seemed to twinkle and
mock at her in fiendish delight. She grasped
the jutting window-frame and jumped upon the
broad sill.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thank God, she had it at last. One snip of
her scissors, and the spark of fire dropped harmlessly
to the ground. She turned slightly to
step off the window-ledge. Her foot slipped
and she fell, a white, faint heap upon the
ground.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>VI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>When she opened her eyes again, not only
Otis Greenough but John Villard and an office-boy
were bending anxiously over her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My dear girl,” the agent was saying, “bless
me, my dear, what is it? How came you here
and who has harmed you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t be alarmed, sir,” was her reply, as
she got on her feet; and then, somewhat
excitedly, she told the events of the last fifteen
or twenty minutes, interrupted, every other
sentence, by such ejaculations as, “Great Scott,”
“Bless me,” “The rascals,” “Confound them,”
from the elderly man, while the younger one
listened in silent amazement.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rapid search was made and the night-watch
was found sleeping, in a stupor which was evidently
the work of a drug; while the police
were, as usual, nowhere to be found.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>Salome was taken into the office—not without
inward trembling, as she feared further
evidences of the miscreants.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Villard soon reported two kegs of gunpowder
and a small dynamite bomb in the
room below, at the same time congratulating,
most heartily, the young woman who had saved
their lives as well as the mills.</p>

<p class='c008'>But her courage was now at a low ebb, and,
woman-like, she shivered at the close proximity
of gunpowder, and begged to be taken home.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Greenough, who had come to realize the
danger to himself and to the mills which his
obstinacy had provoked, was also anxious to leave
the premises and glad to accompany Salome
home.</p>

<p class='c008'>John Villard, meanwhile, attended to the
duty of finding new watchmen who should be
reliable,—a difficult task. Against his will, he
promised Salome not to sleep at the mills, as he
had been doing since the machinery had been
tampered with.</p>

<p class='c008'>Salome was nearly prostrated when she
reached home, and had but little strength left
with which to importune the agent to consent
to any terms for a settlement; but as the old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>man was, for once, thoroughly frightened, it
was not difficult to exact a promise that he
would consider a compromise.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Soule, when she learned of Salome’s
intrepidity,—set forth as it was by Mr. Greenough’s
gratitude and gallant appreciation,—was
greatly concerned for her niece and put her
straightway to bed, where, in fact, she had supposed
her to be for the past hour, and where
she wept over and caressed her as she had not
done since the girl had left home for boarding-school.
And then, what was far more to the
purpose, she gave her a bath of alcohol and
olive oil, and soothed her to sleep.</p>

<p class='c008'>Early the next morning the agent of the
Shawsheen Mills sent a messenger over to the
dingy room which served as headquarters for
the Labor Union, begging for an interview.</p>

<p class='c008'>As this was the first overture of peace from
his side, it was natural that it should be hailed
with glee by the officers of the Union. And
although, the day before, the leaders of the
strike had been closeted together in a serious
debate as to how much they should yield to
Capital, they now unanimously agreed not to
“weaken” in the smallest degree.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>As for the agent, he had been persuaded to
yield every point demanded by the strikers, insisting
only upon the one condition, that the
Labor Union should be disbanded.</p>

<p class='c008'>The question of ten hours he granted without
a murmur. He quibbled a long time over
the wage question, and the subject of weekly
payments, and only on seeing the dogged determination
of the laborers did he come to terms
on that. But he very properly, and too
peremptorily, refused to remove the spinning
frames which had formed one subject
of contention. And then he proceeded to
overthrow the good effects of what concessions
he had made, by violently denouncing all
labor unions, and vigorously insisting that the
one known as the Shawsheen Labor Union be
immediately and forever disbanded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Never,” said the foremost of the committee,
“will we submit to so arbitrary a demand. We
have a perfect right to organize our forces and
assert our claims. How can we—a band of
day-laborers,—dependent on capital for a bare
living, win a single cause for ourselves without
combinations of this kind? There are scores of
questions which involve not our welfare in one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>way alone, but our health, our wages, our
morals, our manhood, which we, as single individuals,
can never cope with, but which, as a
united force, we can adjust. Besides, in all
departments of labor, the women and children
equal or exceed the men. There are to-day
one hundred and seventy-five thousand more
women working in mills than there were ten
years ago; and what are they but the weakest
and most dependent of employes? They have
no strength to agitate; they have no power to
change any existing order of things. All they
can do is to toil and submit. We owe it to
them as men, as husbands, brothers, and sons,
to lighten their burdens. As free American
citizens we owe it to ourselves, to settle the
conditions of our own lives, so far as may be.
This can only be done by combinations of the
laboring classes strong enough to compel manufacturers
to concede us our rights.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are right to a degree,” answered Villard,
before Mr. Greenough could swallow his
surprise at hearing such sentiments from one of
his operatives; “I believe there are some rights
which you can only secure by a combination of
your forces as working-men. But when you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>let reason lose its sway, and passion take its
place; when you are influenced by unworthy
demagogues and unbalanced cranks, and seek
to effect by strikes and such arbitrary measures
what might be better secured by a more conciliatory
course, you must not be surprised if
you do not succeed in bull-dozing a rich concern
like this into obedience, and——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And when, by your —— labour unions, you
sink so low as to countenance incendiarism and
murder—yes, sirs—that is what you attempted
last night, sirs,—you can’t expect this mill is
going to countenance them. I’ll see you all
starve and rot first,” and Otis Greenough’s face
was purple with anger.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We have already disclaimed all knowledge
in our Union, sir,” said one of the committee,
“of last night’s outrage.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Blast it, what do I care for that?” roared
the agent, as usual, out of temper. “Whether
you knew it or not, it was done under cover of
your strike, and your Union, and was one of the
precious outgrowths of it. Give up the ——
thing, I say—or there is no compromise with
these mills.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There is little use in prolonging this interview,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>I am afraid,” said the first of the committee,
taking up his hat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Impudent dogs!” said Mr. Greenough, as
Villard tried to speak, anxious to put things on
a more satisfactory basis before the meeting
closed. “Let them go. They’ll find hard
hoeing before they reach the end of their row.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And, sir,” retorted a fiery-looking man who
had not spoken before, “if it comes to open
war you’ll find us tough customers. We shall
fight it out like men, even if we starve like
beasts.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And with these words the committee departed,
leaving matters worse than ever before in the
affairs of the Shawsheen Mills.</p>

<p class='c008'>In vain did the two superintendents plead
and argue and threaten the choleric old agent.
His blood was up and he was a veritable charger
on the eve of battle. There was no state board
of arbitration then, and therefore no available
way of settling their difficulties except among
themselves. And as discussion only made
matters worse, the subject which was always
uppermost in these three men’s minds was
tacitly dropped. Every precaution was taken
to insure the mills from the danger it had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>escaped the night before, and a detective was
obtained from Boston to hunt out the criminals
who had perpetrated the dastardly act.</p>

<p class='c008'>At noon, they were all surprised by a note
from Miss Shepard. It ran as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Mr. Greenough</span>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“As the owner of the Shawsheen Mill property,
I hereby appoint a meeting of all its
officers at my house, to-night. Please have
them here at eight o’clock.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pardon me for the liberty I have seemed to
take, and believe me ever a loving and respectful
friend,</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Salome Shepard</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Well, you hear that, boys,” said Mr. Greenough,
after reading it aloud. “Be on hand.
Tell the treasurer and cashier and head book-keeper.
We’ll all be there. The Lord only
knows what she is up to; but if that young
woman hasn’t got a level head on her shoulders,
then I don’t know who has.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I reckon you’re right, sir,” echoed Mr.
Burnham, while John Villard laughed in his
sleeve at the young woman who evidently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>dreamed of settling a prolonged strike.
“Why,” he said to himself, “she has never
known enough of the practical side of mill-life
to recognize one of her operatives, and hardly
knows the different brands of cloth manufactured
by them.”</p>

<hr class='c011'>

<p class='c008'>Salome Shepard had waked at an early hour
that morning and found herself unable to
sleep again. Her mind was alive with
gratitude for the part she had been able to
play the night before, with apprehension for
the future, and with increasing self-accusation
for the state of things in the Shawsheen Mills,
both past and present.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pshaw!” she said to herself while dressing,
true to her habit of communing with her own
conscience in default of a visible mentor,
“how can I be blamed for the state of things
here? The entire business of the mills was
put out of my hands by my father’s will. I
could have done no differently.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You could,” replied that sternest of
modern inquisitors—a New England conscience.
“It was in your power to see that the moral
and physical condition of these people was improved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>and cultivated. It was in your power
to give them better homes and more privileges.
It was in your power to raise their standards of
life and to create new ones. But you have
ignored their very existence, and let them live
a mean and sordid life of unremitting toil, in
order to furnish you with money to live a
selfish life of luxurious ease.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Salome tied the blue ribbons to her wrapper,
and giving her crimps a last touch went down
to breakfast.</p>

<p class='c008'>Knowing she would be opposed, she said
nothing of her plans for the morning to her
aunt, but simply announced, after they had
left the table, that she was going for a long
walk.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then she went upstairs and put on the
plainest costume she owned (which, by the way,
was a tailor-made gown that had cost her one
hundred and fifty dollars), and started for the
tenement houses where her operatives lived.</p>

<p class='c008'>It did not occur to her to feel any fear; nor
that the miscreants who had planned the explosion
for the previous night might be watching
her footsteps. She felt it incumbent upon
her to see for herself exactly how these people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>lived, and what they were bearing and suffering
in consequence of the strike.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the bright glare of the morning sun, the
tenement houses had never looked so dingy and
mean. They were built in Newbern Shepard’s
day, and had received but very few repairs
since that time. Although it was cold January
weather, Salome counted a dozen panes of
glass gone from the first house, and noticed
that the lower hinge to the front door was
broken. It was a two-story wooden building
with four tenements of four rooms each.</p>

<p class='c008'>She ascended the rickety steps and rapped
on the door. One of the women saw her from
a front window and came to the door, holding
it open only so far as to permit her to see the
strange caller.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good-morning,” said Salome in pleasant
tones.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good-morning, miss.” The politeness of
Salome’s manner thawed the other woman, and
the door opened a little wider. “Will you
walk in?”</p>

<p class='c008'>That was precisely what she had come for,
and Salome stepped inside with alacrity. She
found herself in the sitting-room and living-room
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>of the family. It was a meager home.
The remnant of a faded oil-cloth was on the
floor. The walls were unpapered and devoid
of any attempts at ornament, except one unframed,
dilapidated old lithograph of “The
Queen of the West,”—a buxom young woman
with disproportionately large black eyes, a
dress of bright scarlet cut extremely <i><span lang="fr">décolleté</span></i>,
and cheeks of a yet more vivid hue. A pine
table covered with a stamped red cloth was
littered with cheap, trashy story-papers and
pamphlets addressed “To the Laboring Men
of America.” An old lounge, with broken
springs, and six common wooden chairs constituted
the other furnishings of the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>Salome’s first thought as she looked about
her was:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t wonder these people get discontented
and clamor for something which seems
to them better.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But she found, before the forenoon was over,
many houses that were not so pleasant as this.
For, once inside these rooms, everything was
neat and clean, and the woman who answered
her questions was civil if not talkative.</p>

<p class='c008'>She found that five people lived in these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>four small rooms: this woman, her two
daughters, a son-in-law, and a grandchild.
She also found that the other tenements contained
five, six, and seven people, making
twenty-three in all. There were absolutely no
sanitary arrangements, and she discovered that
the sanitation of this tenement house district
consisted only of surface drainage. According to
the statements of her hostess, there was nearly
always somebody “ailing” in these houses.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first house she went into was a fair
sample of the remainder. A few were slightly
better, but more were in a worse condition. In
most instances she was respectfully received,
although at three houses she was met by ungracious
people, and received gruff replies to
her kindly-put inquiries.</p>

<p class='c008'>Everywhere, strong, able-bodied men were
lounging about in enforced idleness; and one
of them, resenting, with true American independence,
this intrusion into the sacred precincts
of his miserable home, plainly intimated
that “they was well enough off now, and didn’t
want no rich folks as was livin’ on money <em>they</em>
earned, to come pryin’ round their houses.”
Finally, at the last of the tenement houses she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>was met by a surly, burly mule-spinner, who
gruffly refused her admittance.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nothing daunted, however, she sought out a
boarding-house for the young women of the
mills. The landlady, recognizing her, invited
her in and willingly told her all about the life
of mill-girls, offering, at last, to show her their
rooms.</p>

<p class='c008'>Salome gladly accepted and followed the
woman up bare, unpainted stairs to the rooms
on the second and third floors. These were
small and perfectly bare of comforts, almost of
necessities. The floors were uncarpeted and
guiltless of paint, or even of a very recent application
of soap and water. They had no closets.
A common pine bedstead—sometimes two of
them—in each room, two chairs, in one of
which stood a tin basin, while beside it on the
floor stood a bucket of water, and a small
bureau, made up the sum total of the furniture.
In only one room did Salome see any evidences
of a literary taste, and that, if she had known
it, was a cheap paper, the worst of the sensational
class.</p>

<p class='c008'>Salome’s heart sank within her. She no
longer wondered that the mill-girls of to-day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>were a discontented, ignorant set, nor that
many of them sank into lives of degradation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The rooms are good enough for the girls,”
said the woman, noticing the look of disgust
on Salome’s tell-tale face. “They seem poor
enough to elegant ladies like you. But these
girls know no better. And they are good
enough to sleep off a drunk in,” she added,
roughly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You don’t mean to say,” asked her guest,
“that any of your girls get intoxicated?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Intoxicated? I don’t know what else
you’d call it, when they have to be helped in
at eleven o’clock Saturday night, and put to
bed, and don’t get up again until Monday
morning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Salome was sick with pity and shame for
her sex. She no longer questioned whether
she had a mission toward these, her people.</p>

<p class='c008'>She went home and wrote the note to Mr.
Greenough, given in an earlier part of this
chapter.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>VII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Promptly, at the hour named, Otis Greenough,
accompanied by the other officers of the
mill, appeared at the mansion of the Shepard
family.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tall, beautiful, and always impressive in her
bearing, Salome was at her best to-night.
The fire of a new-born purpose was in her
face, and a new force, born of spiritual struggles,
stamped upon her brow.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are people who can look calmly upon
a sunset, and see nothing but a glare of red and
yellow light. There are others who see in it
a glorious picture with matchless tints and
shadows. There are yet others, fewer, indeed,
than the rest, but who hold the secret of God’s
holy purpose written more or less plainly in
their souls; who see not only the glare of red
and yellow light, whose brilliant tints and deep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>tones make an unrivaled picture, but who read
something of the deeper meanings of the Great
Artist; who receive into their own hearts some
part of the glowing light which strengthens
purpose, and crystallizes hopes and ideals
hitherto dreamy and undefined.</p>

<p class='c008'>Salome Shepard had stood at a western
window at sunset. In the hush and stillness
of the hour, the poet-quality of her soul
had interpreted to her the meaning of life
and the great fact of human brotherhood.
And when she finally drew the curtains on the
deepening night, she felt that a sudden revelation
had come to her—that, at last, her life
purpose, in the shape of a sternly defined duty,
stood revealed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” said Mr. Greenough, after a few
moments of aimless conversation, for nobody
seemed desirous of taking the initiative,
“what are you going to do with us all to-night,
little girl? Don’t you think you rather usurp
the privileges of an old man in calling together
a meeting to discuss business, of which he is
the legal head? Come, give an account of
yourself and your quixotic actions.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I beg that none of you will think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>that.” And Salome looked around the room
appealingly. “I simply wished that we might
have a fair and honest talk. I want every one
here to express his views. And I want to express
mine—for at last, thank heaven, I have
some.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Getting strong-minded, eh?” retorted Mr.
Greenough. “Well, go on. I suppose you
want to practice on us before taking a larger
field. Going to take the suffrage platform?
or build school-houses for the niggers? Or do
you aspire to the bureau of Indian Affairs?
Which is it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“None of them,” responded Salome, inwardly
resenting the untimely jest, but determined
not to show her impatience. “None of them.
I propose to begin nearer home. I propose to
go to work, earnestly, and I hope practically,
to raise the condition, morally, mentally and
physically, of my own factory-people.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bravo!” exclaimed Villard and the head
book-keeper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And I have called you here,” pursued
Salome, “to ask each and every one of you to
be my assistant and coadjutor. I have not
been thinking of nothing, during the last three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>months. I am a woman, comparatively young,
and with absolutely no knowledge of the practical
side of a working-man’s life. But I have
been thinking, and my conclusions are these:
that a strike is a much more serious matter for
the working-people than it is for us. We act
as if they go out on a strike either to annoy us
or to have a good time. I have been down
among them—sought the by-ways and
hedges, as it were—and I tell you they
are having anything but a good time.
This strike is the outcome of want and privation,
and it has brought the people to still
greater want and privation. I believe they are
not a set of noisy malcontents on the lookout
for an opportunity to create a disturbance.
On the contrary, they see in this course the
only chance of bringing before the public questions
of vital importance to them. They earn
their bread by the sweat of their brow—and
not always good bread either,—while we, as
capitalists, are hoarding up money. At the
most, they get very little of what their work
really yields. I desire, above all things, sir,
that you grant their desires and no longer
require them to give up their Labor Union.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>Capitalists have their Board of Trade, which
virtually amounts to the same thing. Let the
workmen have their one chance to assert themselves
by a combination of their forces. And
let each side show to the other that tolerance
and Christian charity which each demands
from the other.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What about the tolerance and Christian
charity of the outrage they tried to perpetrate
last night?” asked Mr. Greenough.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do not believe the Labor Union is responsible
for that,” replied Salome, with a far-seeing
sympathy in her eyes. “Unfortunately
it was an outgrowth of their opinions, passions
and prejudices. But you must confess, sir,
that had you met them with the tolerance
which the growing spirit of the age demands,
there is little likelihood that matters would
ever have reached the point where such an
action could have been planned. I want this
strike ended on any terms. I want to see the
operatives, every one of them, at work again at
fair wages. And then, God helping me, I propose
to do something for their elevation—something
to help them live better, cleaner,
manly and womanly lives—something which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>shall carry out my grandfather’s noble plans,
and help make the factory system of New
England one of her grandest achievements.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Miss Shepard is right,” said Mr. Burnham:
“our factory, like many another, has been run
too long on the system of <i><span lang="fr">laissez-faire</span></i>. I have
come to believe in a political economy which
insists upon the liveliest activity on the part of
capitalists, to put their employes upon the best
possible footing as to the material surroundings
of life; that they have all the advantage
as to health, morals and happiness which comes
from sanitary regulation and practical education.
I believe that only when we adopt such
a political economy as this shall we draw the
largest possible dividends from the products of
a community comparatively free from crime,
intemperance, poverty and vice of every kind.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” urged Villard, “each one of us,
laborer or capitalist, has duties to perform
which cannot be shirked or shifted to the
shoulders of Fate—another name for the theory
of <i><span lang="fr">laissez-faire</span></i>. The new political economy
will demand that every one who, in his or her
public or private capacity, can do anything to
relieve misery, to combat evil, to redress wrong,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>to assert the right, shall do so with heart and
soul.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You see,” said Salome, delighted that two
strong, thinking men thus endorsed and voiced
her sentiments, “we have been acting on the
Quaker’s advice to his son: ‘Make money—honestly
if you can; but make money.’ We
have forgotten that Christianity says: ‘Thou
shalt love thy neighbor as thyself,’ ‘Do unto
others as ye would that men should do unto
you,’ ‘Bear one another’s burdens,’ and ‘Love
one another.’ But we have practically said:
‘Love thyself; seek thine own advantage; promote
thine own welfare; put money in thy purse;
the welfare of others is not thy business.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I must confess,” answered Otis Greenough,
speaking slowly and huskily, “that I cannot,
after a life-long devotion to old-fashioned ideas,
take any stock in these new-fangled, impracticable
ones. I cannot, at my time of life, change
my ideas; and neither can I endorse your proposition
to make a public spectacle of ourselves
in the future. Mills are run to make money.
So long as I hold the position imposed upon
me by the late Floyd Shepard, so long shall
I refuse to countenance extravagance and quixotism.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>But I am an old man. No one cares
any longer what I think. It is the young
people with no experience whose opinions count
nowadays. I am an old man who has had his
day——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t, I beg of you, sir, talk like that,”
interrupted Salome. “We do value your
opinion; we do intend to refer to your judgment;
we——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is that?” cried Mrs. Soule in alarm,
from her seat near the window.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is some one throwing gravel against the
panes,” said the cashier as a second shower
came rattling against the window. He parted
the curtains and looked out.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The grounds are full of men. We are
mobbed, by George!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The old agent’s blood was up in a moment,
and regardless of the presence of ladies he
swore in good, set terms, that the rascals
should be arrested and imprisoned for this.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then, unconscious of danger, in spite of the
attempts of Villard and the rest to hold him
back, he marched, like an old hero, boldly out
on to the veranda which faced a crowd of
excited workmen.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>They had held a stormy meeting at the
Labor Union, and the worst element among
them had become desperate, and swore to
“bring the old man to terms.” They had gone
in a body to the mills, where they hoped to
find some of their employers in consultation.
There they had found that the whole force
of their opponents had gone to the great
Shepard Mansion. Nothing daunted, they
turned their steps thither, and at every street
corner were joined by the element of hoodlumism
which is always scattered about over the
streets of a large and poorly-governed town.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hence the mob that confronted the officers
of the Shawsheen Mills held all the elements
of danger and disturbance.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Otis Greenough’s bald head appeared
before them, the crowd set up a yell of mingled
derision and defiance.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Give us our rights, old Baldy” shouted one
voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Give us fair play and fair wages,” called
another, while worse epithets were hurled at
him, from the roughs in the rear.</p>

<p class='c008'>Otis Greenough’s face was purple.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is outrageous!” he exclaimed in hot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>haste. “What right have you to come here
and defile an honest citizen’s premises with
your wretched, polluting presence?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stop that, now!” shouted one of the leaders.
“Fair play all round. If you won’t come to
us, we’ll come to you, and compel you to make
terms, and decent ones, with us. We want——”</p>

<p class='c008'>But the crowd of street idlers who had come
in search of excitement, and not argument, grew
restless, and broke in noisily; and when Otis
Greenough opened his mouth to speak again,
he was struck squarely in the face by a handful
of gravel and mud.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then a sudden hush fell over the mob.</p>

<p class='c008'>For what was this unexpected white form
which appeared in the doorway, and advanced
to meet them?</p>

<p class='c008'>Salome was dressed in a clinging, white, soft
serge, with falls of fine lace at the neck and
wrists, and under the dim light of the piazza-lamp,
she seemed like an angel of retribution,
her eyes flaming reproach, and her hands raised
in deprecation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Aren’t you ashamed of yourselves?” she
burst forth, in ringing tones. “You, who call
yourselves honest men, and loyal citizens! You
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>who come here with a claim for fair play, you
who come here to assert the right of every
American to be treated with respect by every
other; to insult and maltreat an old man with
white hair—a man whom, as a long associate
in your work, you should honor? Do you
come to my house to call forth a man who
was even now listening to plans for the improvement
of your homes and lives and prospects,
simply that you may turn yourselves into
a pack of dogs to bark at him? Go home.
Lay aside your prejudices and your low, unworthy
passions, and think whether we be
entirely in the wrong. Think whether you are
showing yourselves worthy of being trusted?
Go home and weigh calmly your conduct
against that of these officers, and decide for
yourselves whether you deserve to be met half-way.
And I give you my word of honor as
owner of the Shawsheen Mills, that when you
decide to behave like men and not like beasts,
you shall be treated as men. You shall have
good places with good pay. You shall find
that we are willing to do as much as—yes,
more, than you are willing to do for us, and
that we will meet you half-way in the open,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>fair discussion of all points connected with the
labor question.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Three cheers for the lady!” shouted a
hoodlum, who cared not which side he was on,
provided he could make a noise.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the cheers were stayed, and further demonstration
was choked in utterance. For
Otis Greenough fell suddenly at the feet of
the woman who stood there boldly championing
him and her sense of right.</p>

<p class='c008'>The superintendent carried him quickly within
and put him on a sofa; a physician was hastily
summoned, and in a few words Villard dismissed
the mob, now hushed and awe-stricken.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Otis Greenough in one moment had
passed beyond the disturbances of howling
malcontents, beyond the petty smallness of his
old-fashioned and cramped ideas, out into that
world where there is no fear of anarchy and
socialism, no disgrace in being a philanthropist,
no bounds to the heart of love for all mankind,
and no limits to the horizon of a larger,
diviner life.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>VIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Death is never fully realized until he is an
actual presence; and Otis Greenough’s sudden
demise before their eyes and almost under, if
not by, their own hands, solemnized and terrified
the mob, and brought the strikers to a sense of
the desperate pass to which they had come.</p>

<p class='c008'>The members of the Labor Union laid their
grievances aside for the time, and paid every
mark of respect to the old agent now that he
had passed beyond the recognition of it. A
sudden fit of apoplexy had blotted out his
choleric and intolerant behavior, and left only
the remembrance that he had been their head
for many years.</p>

<p class='c008'>But when he had been laid away in the new
cemetery on Shepard Hill, the smouldering
embers of discord began again to break forth
into hot flames of prejudice and passion.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>Geoffrey Burnham and John Villard were consulting
together in the mill office the day after
the funeral, when the door opened and the
owner of the mills walked in.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have come,” she said, in answer to their
ill-concealed surprise, “to talk over the situation
of the strike. I want the mills re-opened.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We shall be only too happy to comply
with your wishes, Miss Shepard,” said Burnham,
placing a chair in a comfortable light for
her. “Upon what terms do you propose it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want to compromise,” she answered,
“and give them a better chance than they have
ever had. It may take us some time to decide
on the exact terms. Would it be better, do you
think,”—she unconsciously turned to Villard—“to
take them back on the old terms, re-instate
them precisely as they were, and then go
on and make our changes?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That would hardly do,” he replied. “Experience
has proved them very jealous of new
methods, and unwilling to consent to untried
theories. If we yield everything they demand
now, we shall establish a bad precedent; eh,
Burnham?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Decidedly, and we shall meet with opposition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>if we undertake any changes. If there is
to be a remodeling of the old system, it had
better come now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There must be a remodeling, it seems to
me,” urged Salome. “Dear Mr. Greenough
acted wisely, so far as he could, no doubt; but
I feel that the time is come to make decided
changes here. Perhaps I am not very clear in
regard to them, even in my own mind. But I
have some idea of what I want, and I shall be
glad to have you both state your convictions
and objections, if you have them, relating to
everything I propose.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It will be no light matter,” said Burnham,
“to select a plan and perfect it at once. It
must be a work of time and much thought.
Still, what is your idea?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want to put the relations between us and
the employes,” Salome went on, “on a better
footing—an ethical basis, if you like the term.
We must combine the question ‘Will it pay?’
with a higher one, ‘Is it right?’”</p>

<p class='c008'>The two men looked at each other. Burnham
bit his lip.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do not propose to promise the people an
era of absolute prosperity and uninterrupted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>progress, and let them take it as a blind destiny
without exertion or sacrifice or patriotism on
their part. I want to teach them to be healthy,
intelligent, and virtuous citizens, and to expect
from us the treatment such citizens deserve.
I believe that such a course is for the pecuniary
interests of the mill, as well as for theirs. I
have heard enough of the conflicting interests
of labor and capital; and on the other hand I
do not believe in the twaddle that proclaims
them one. I believe they are reciprocal,
and that we must take that idea as fundamental.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You propose a radical change, I fear.”
Geoffrey Burnham’s tone held a new respect
for this woman whom he had believed wrapped
up in the toils of worldly and shallow aims.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I may as well own it; I do,” assented
Salome. “Among my grandfather’s manuscripts,
I came across, the other day, these
sentences: ‘I would like to prove my luminous
ideal of what a superintendent may be among
his people. I would like to live long enough
to show the world that the spirit of the Crucified
may rule in a cotton-mill as fully as in
the life of a saint.’ That sentence, gentlemen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>must speak for me. In those words lies the
germ of my plan of action.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Silence followed her. Geoffrey Burnham
told himself that a new era must be dawning,—the
era foreshadowing the millennium, since she
who held the power could so bravely avow her
intentions to make the Shawsheen Mills an
experiment in what he called Christian socialism.
But John Villard, after a moment, rose
and extended his hand to Salome.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I pledge my hearty co-operation,” he said,
“and thank God for the opportunity to prove
what a cotton-mill may become by the new
Christian political economy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you,” said Salome. “And now
let us see just what the strikers demand, and
how far we can grant their wishes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>John Villard produced the paper which had
been presented on the first day of the strike,
and placed it in Salome’s hands. It was the
first time she had seen it. She read it through
very carefully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It seems to me there was no need of these
long months of idleness,” she commented,
when she had finished the paper. “Now, let
us see. First, they demand recognition, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>the Shawsheen Labor Union. I think we may
yield that point, safely enough.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Without modification?” inquired Geoffrey
Burnham.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They will take advantage of us. They
will dictate and become arbitrary. The Labor
Union grows by what it feeds on. It will become
an elephant on our hands.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not if they have something better to take
its place,” said Salome. “I am fully persuaded
that they will meet us half-way, if we give them
a union that is better than theirs. Let their
union alone for the present.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am with you there,” said Villard. “It
devolves upon us to change its character into
something that shall be, at least, as helpful as
they <em>want</em> to make this one.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Next, the ten-hour system,” pursued Salome,
who was not yet ready to discuss the
improved union. “Certainly there can be
no possible objection against granting this
clause?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Certainly not,” said Burnham, feeling himself
appealed to.</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘The new frames must be taken out and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>the mules replaced, with a written agreement
that no more of the obnoxious machinery shall
be added for five years.’ That seems rather
arbitrary. How is it, Mr. Villard?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is arbitrary,” he responded. “The
frames must be retained. We must be allowed
to adopt improved machines and methods, or
where shall we be in this age of competition?
But I think there will be little trouble with
the men, if I am allowed to approach them in
the right way. Anyhow, I will try.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do so,” was the reply. “Make them see
that improved methods are for their interest as
much as for ours. As to the wage-section—were
their wages actually cut down?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” replied both men.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That must not be allowed,” said Salome.
“The mills were paying a handsome profit
when this was done, weren’t they?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They were,” said Villard. “Better than
for a year before.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Give them their old pay, with the understanding
that wages will be increased when
work is heavier. I propose to myself a wild
scheme of profit-sharing, or a sliding scale of
wages, in the future.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>“Good,” cried Villard. “The very thing
I’ve been wanting to try. I believe in it
heartily. But where did you get the idea of
it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I’ve been reading all the practical
articles I could find on political economy, as
applied to mills and factories, for some months,”
Salome replied, “and I have evolved some queer
theories, I fear; but I propose to give them a
fair trial, unless you pronounce them too visionary.
I am glad you approve of profit-sharing.
And you, Mr. Burnham?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I approve of making the experiment,” said
the more cautious superintendent. “I do not
jump at conclusions. Nevertheless, the idea,
though new, looks practicable, and I should
like to see it tried.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They have already tried it in one or two
places where it is proving a great success, I
believe,” said Salome. “You know the experiment
was tried as long ago as 1831, when
Mr. John S. Vandeleur put it into effect successfully
in County Clare, Ireland. The Paris
and Orleans Railway Company began to share
profit with its employes in 1844, and the Maison
Leclaire, I think, two years before, both of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>which have proved very successful. I do not
see why we cannot adopt it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We can,” asserted Villard, confidently.
“It is already being tried on a small scale by
several firms in this country. Why should not
we join the procession?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What are you going to do about the demand
for weekly wages?” asked Burnham.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What objections are there?” Salome
asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It will entail extra expense for clerks and
book-keepers,” responded Burnham. “That
seems unnecessary.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The men claim that they have to depend
in great measure on the credit system at the
stores,” explained Villard. “Their wages
coming only once a month, they get short of
money. If sickness or other additional expense
comes upon them, they are often seriously
inconvenienced by lack of their rightful wages.
Again, if they are able to put a little money in
the savings-bank, why should they not have the
benefit of the interest that accrues through the
month, rather than we? The money is theirs.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“On the other hand,” interrupted Burnham,
“those men whose first duty, on being paid off,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>seems to lie in getting gloriously drunk, would
have the opportunity just four times as
often.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We have a work to do in that direction,”
said Salome in a pained voice. “In a sense we
are our brother’s keepers. I half believe that
the solution of the temperance question is
largely in the control of the employers of labor;
and that the secondary, and often the primary,
causes of intemperance are bad and unwholesome
food, which create a craving for drink;
bad company, which tempts it; squalid houses,
which drive men forth for cheerfulness; and
the want of more comfortable places of resort
which leaves them no refuge but the saloons.
It is in our power to remedy all these evils.
Give them good sanitation, well-ventilated
houses, comfortable homes, and reading-rooms,
and coffee-parlors, and only the most depraved
will be tempted by the low saloons.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, Miss Shepard, surely you do not propose
all these things?” and Geoffrey Burnham
looked his astonishment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why not?” was the terse reply.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where will your profits come in? You
cannot afford it.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>Salome smiled. Her money was her own.
Why should she not use it as she pleased?</p>

<p class='c008'>“No. For the first year or two I shall not
pocket an immense profit; that is true,” she
assented. “But I am not likely to come to
want. And Newbern Shepard’s mills must
be put on the basis where he desired, above all
things, to see them during his lifetime. He
planned a noble scheme. It is my birthright
and my duty to carry it into effect. It will
cost me something to get the mills where they
must be; but it will pay in the end. Of that
I feel sure.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are quite right,” said John Villard.
“What may we not hope for when the condition
of the working-people shall receive that
concentrated attention which has hitherto been
devoted to the more favored ranks? When
charity, which has, for ages past, done so much
mischief, shall learn to do good? When the
countless pulpits of our country, which have
always been so active in preaching Catholicism
or Anglicism, Calvinism or Armenianism, and
all other isms, shall preach pure and simple
Christianity? When, by a healthy environment
of the toiling masses, and the exercise of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>hygienic sense and science, mankind shall be
healthy and free from questionable instincts and
morbidly exaggerated appetites? I tell you,
we cannot even approach an estimate of the
extent to which every improvement, social,
moral or material, reacts on the nation’s ethical
and intellectual progress, and the prosperity of
her industries.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you are taking us entirely away from
the question in hand,” said Geoffrey Burnham,
“which was, shall we grant the demand for
weekly wages?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not so far away as you seem to think,”
retorted Villard. “The questions of sanitation
and morality affect them, and us too, as
well as the question of weekly wages. As
for the latter, I am in favor of trying it
on.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So am I,” said Salome. “I am in favor
of trying every new method until we can know
positively which are the best ones.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“With modifications,” said Burnham, smiling
at her vehemence. “I don’t exactly approve
of the weekly system, but the majority
are against me, and I may as well cast my vote
with yours. Shall we send for their committee,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>then, and offer them all concessions, except
those relating to the spinning frames?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I should do so,” said Salome, “and
prepare to open the mills at once, provided
they decide to accept our terms.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is practically decided already,”
laughed Burnham, “by our accepting theirs.
Villard, you may negotiate with them about
the frames. They are inclined to listen to you
better than to me, for some reason.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They know I’ve been in their place,” said
Villard. “That makes all the difference in
the world to them. They think I understand
their side of the question; that is all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then you will confer with them immediately?”
said Salome, rising to go. “And will
you make all necessary preparations to open the
mills? And then will you confer with me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Most certainly, Miss Shepard.” Geoffrey
Burnham spoke for both of them. “But—I
beg your pardon, you have not spoken of a
new agent. We must have one, you know.
I trust you have made some wise selection?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am prepared to surprise you,” Salome
replied, buttoning her glove. “You two men
will oblige me by transacting all necessary business
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>for the present, in your positions of first
and second superintendents, and by looking
closely after the thousand details which I do
not yet understand. Meanwhile, I shall come
to the office every day and, with your co-operation
and kind help, shall learn the business.
I have too many schemes for the general
improvement of the Shawsheen Mills and its
operatives, to trust the mills in the hands of
a stranger. I propose to be my own agent.
Good-morning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Salome Shepard never looked handsomer, or
smiled more sweetly, than she did when she
uttered the last sentence, and closed the door
behind her, leaving her two completely astonished
hearers standing in the middle of the
office.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Whe-e-w!” ejaculated Geoffrey Burnham,
after a little. “How does that strike you?
The Shawsheen Mills run by a ‘female woman,’
as A. Ward would put it! And, by George!
we are expected to stay and work,—under a
woman!”</p>

<p class='c008'>John Villard broke into a peal of laughter.
“It’s awfully funny at first,” he said, calming
down again. “But, after all, why not?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>She isn’t the empty-headed, aimless creature
we thought her. She’s read and studied, and
has some very sound notions.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, Villard—a woman-agent!” gasped
Burnham. “We shall be the laughing-stock
of the whole state.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let them laugh,” answered Villard. “They
laugh best who laugh last. And with her
notions, her thirst for further knowledge, her
enthusiasm, and, above all, her money, the
Shawsheen Mills will be in a position at the
end of a few years to do the laughing, while
those who laugh at us now will set to studying
our methods and come to us for advice.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But she knows nothing of the practical
part of mill-economy,” objected Burnham. “The
mills will go to rack and ruin. Jove! Old
Mr. Greenough would turn over in his grave
if he could have heard her as she stopped
in the door and said: ‘I propose to be my
own agent.’ A woman!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know,” replied Villard, “that it will
seem odd, and perhaps uncomfortably so, at first,
to acknowledge her as head. But, after all,
she does not propose to dictate as to the
business itself.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>“She will,” interrupted Burnham. “Women
always do. She will jump at conclusions,
mistake her inferences for logical deductions and
the wisdom which comes only with experience,
and, after the first month, will know more than
we do. I know women. They are impulsive
and illogical; and they can’t subvert nature and
become good business men.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No; but they may prove good business
women,” was Villard’s answer. “We do not
know, yet, what she can or what she will do.
I believe she will be willing to leave the details
of the business to us yet, for a long time. She
is not a conceited woman; and although she
has the faculty common to her sex of making
some surprising jumps at conclusions, I do not
believe her to be obstinate about them. She
proposes to make a study of the business, and
realizes that this is a work of years. And,
besides, what will save the mills is this: she
has an extended plan in manuscript of her
grandfather’s scheme for making this an ideal
institution. If she is willing to leave the
business to us for the present, and is capable
of adapting Newbern Shepard’s theories of
years ago to the needs of to-day, we are all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>right, Jeff; and a new era is about to begin
for the Shawsheen Mills.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I only hope we may like it,” assented
Burnham doubtfully. “And now for the
conference with the Labor Union.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Marion Shaw was one of those women whose
lives are a constant giving of their best, with
no thought of return. We have all seen such
women. From the self-sacrificing maiden aunt
in the humblest home, up to the Florence
Nightingales and Dorothea Dixes of the world,
they are God’s angels, everywhere, to suffering
humanity.</p>

<p class='c008'>Marion Shaw and Salome Shepard had been
in boarding-school together; and although the
former had been left from the start to support
herself and her widowed mother, the friendship
between the two girls had never abated.</p>

<p class='c008'>Marion’s mother had died a year before, and
something material had dropped out of life
for the girl. Grief and the solitude which
ensued after her mother’s death told upon her
constitution; and when Salome’s letter of invitation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>reached her, it was like a boon from
Heaven. She threw up her situation in
Madame Blanc’s private school and went to
Shepardtown, arriving there late in the evening,
before Salome’s visit to the counting-room.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the latter came home they settled cosily
in Salome’s room for an “old-time talk,” such
as they had enjoyed as girls.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why didn’t you let me know you were
tired to death with that interminable teaching?”
asked Salome. “I should have had you
come to me long ago. You are as pale as a
ghost.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I’m all right now,” answered Marion,
who never cared to talk of herself. “Tell me
about the strike here. I read of it in a Boston
newspaper, when it came on, and again when
Mr. Greenough died. But, after the fashion
of newspapers with regard to anything you
care particularly to follow up, they dropped
the subject the minute one’s interest was
roused. And your letter was so meager! Yes,
it was. You only write the barest details, and
not too many of them. Is the strike ended?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, but I hope it will be before night,”
Salome replied. “I’ve given orders this morning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>that a compromise be made at once. Yes,
don’t stare at me, please. Why shouldn’t I
give orders? They’re my mills.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m not staring. It’s vulgar to stare, and
the lady professors at Mme. Blanc’s fashionable
boarding-school do not stare. Why, it
would be as much as their position is worth!”
retorted Marion. “Yes, they’re your mills, I
suppose, and a handsome piece of property
they are too, in the eyes of poor me, who own
only the clothes on my back. But, pardon
me, dear, it does seem a little odd to hear
Salome Shepard, the most exclusive and the
most fashionable girl at school, talk about
giving orders in a cotton-mill. You’re not
getting strong-minded, are you, dear?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If to begin to take an active interest in
two thousand souls, who are dependent upon my
money and the business interests it represents,
is to become strong-minded, I’m afraid I shall
have to plead guilty.” Salome looked narrowly
at her friend. Possibly she had mistaken
her, and their sympathies were farther apart
than she had hoped.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bless you!” responded Marion heartily,
“I’m strong-minded myself; want to vote and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>all that. Don’t believe intemperance and lots
of other evils will ever be subdued in this
country, until women have something to say,
and say it through the ballot-box. It is not
so very dreadful when you once get on to that
platform, is it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I hadn’t thought of voting particularly,”
Salome hastened to answer. “I don’t
really think I want that. But I do want to do
something for my people.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And you’ll find,” retorted Marion, “before
you’ve gone very far, that if you had the power
of legislation, you could help them ten times
as well.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Possibly,” Salome answered, doubtfully.
“But, Marion, there are so many things
absolutely necessary to be done for the Shawsheen
operatives. If you could see them and the
homes they live in, the temptations to which
they are exposed, the poverty in which they
live!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And you propose to go to work among
them,—to reform them?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, God helping me; them and the
factory system together. Behold me,” said
Salome, rising to her full height, and putting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>on a mock-tragic air: “Behold and see: Salome
Shepard, Reformer. That’s my platform.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Salome, dear, what do you mean?” Mrs.
Soule had just come in. “Don’t mind her,
Marion, she delights in hearing herself talk
like a suffrage leader, lately. I don’t approve
of it, as she knows; but I can only wait for
the mood to pass.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Which it never will, aunty dear,” Salome
hastened to say. “So long as I live and am
in a condition to work for the people who need
substantial and material aid, as these people do,
my life will be devoted to their service. I cannot
go on living the aimless, indifferent life
which has been mine ever since I left school.
I must have some active interest, or I shall
stagnate, or, worse still, settle into a cold, hard,
selfish woman of the world. Unfortunately I
was born with a heart; unfortunately for your
ideal of the proper young lady of the period, I
was born with a conscience, and this conscience
tells me that my fortune was given me only in
trust. It is not mine for selfish enjoyment
alone; it is mine to make the world better and
happier and purer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And you are going to work among those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>miserable drunken operatives,” said her aunt
coldly, “whose sordid lives, and ungrateful
hearts, the whole of them, are not worth the
effort of even one month of your life, even if
you were at all a capable woman of affairs, a
woman of judgment and discretion, a woman
of sound business sense,—which you are not.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, ‘among the drunken miserable operatives,’”
replied Salome, ignoring the latter part
of her aunt’s speech. “Among those sordid
lives and ungrateful hearts, that were worth
the Christ’s dying, and for whom He worked,
living.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You don’t think of joining the Salvation
Army, I hope?” exclaimed her aunt, quite
beside herself at this new development of her
niece’s purposes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Salome laughed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shall hardly have the time, aunty. I’ve
accepted a position at the Shawsheen Mills.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A position?” gasped Mrs. Soule. “Oh,
Salome! Who offered you—who <em>dared</em> offer
you a <em>position</em>?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The fair owner of the mills offered it,”
answered Salome, enjoying the situation to
its fullest extent. “And I accepted, aunty.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>Marion, in me you see the agent of the Shawsheen
Mills!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Marion Shaw rose and clasped her friend
closely to her bosom. She admired her splendid
courage and avowed principles, and honored
this woman, with money and leisure at her
command, who was willing and anxious to devote
her life to service for others. But not so
Mrs. Soule.</p>

<p class='c008'>She applied a delicate mull and lace handkerchief
to her eyes, and wept to think to what
an end had come her years of training; her
careful watch, that Salome should never, by any
chance, come in contact with a lower world;
her life-long aim to make of Salome the perfect
being prescribed by her somewhat limited and
narrowed rules of ladyhood.</p>

<p class='c008'>She begged; she pleaded; she argued; she
threatened; she resorted to ridicule; but
Salome stood firm, and now laughingly and
then earnestly defended the course she had
taken.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s of no use, aunty, as you see, for us to
argue the case. I do not forget all your kindness
and love for me; but I must choose for
myself,” she said, finally. “I am old enough
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>to decide questions of right and wrong. Hereafter
we will not argue any more. I must do
this; you must submit; and that is all there
is about it. Now, let’s make up and be friends,”
and she bent down and kissed her aunt on both
cheeks, as she used to do when she was a little
girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You, a child of Cora de Bourdillon’s!”
murmured her aunt, softening a little.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Cora de Bourdillon was my mother,” said
Salome. “But before and above all else, Newbern
Shepard was my grandfather. I am like
him. I must be like him. And you must
submit to the laws of heredity.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So there was never any more prolonged discussion
between them. Salome’s nature being
so much the stronger, kind-hearted, weak Mrs.
Soule could not oppose her further. But many
times, in after years, was she heard to deplore
the fact that Cora de Bourdillon’s child was
so thorough-going an epitome of Newbern
Shepard.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A good man,” she would say. “A perfectly
honest and well-meaning man; but not
like Us!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>X.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Early that evening Geoffrey Burnham and
John Villard were announced. Mrs. Soule and
Salome were alone in the parlors when they
came in, but Marion was sent for.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And you’ve brought good news?” asked
Salome. “They’ve consented to go to work
again?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course,” Burnham replied. “They
were only too glad to meet us on any sort of
terms.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wait till my friend comes down,” said
Salome. “She is interested, and will want to
hear the details. Oh, here she is. Miss Shaw,
allow me to present my two confrères (and
teachers as well), Mr. Burnham and Mr. Villard.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And so it is really settled?” Salome asked,
“and the mills are to be opened again?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>“Monday morning, if you like,” replied Burnham,
“or earlier. But to-day is Wednesday,
and there are many things to be done where
the mills have stood idle for months.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m so glad,” returned Salome.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There is hearty rejoicing throughout the
corporation,” said Villard. “I was coming
through there to-night and met a couple of little
boys with bundles of groceries in their arms.
The smallest looked up and smiled. ‘We’re
going to have a good supper of meat and potato
to-night,’ he said. ‘The mills are going to
open and pa’s got work.’ I asked him how
long since he had had meat, and he said not
since Christmas; and even then he only had
a turkey’s wing that somebody gave him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Poor boy! Tell me about your conference
with the Labor Union.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It passed off smoothly,” Villard went on.
“Burnham told him we came from you, and
were prepared to make terms with them. We
only saw the committee you know, and they
are to lay our terms before the Union to-night;
but there is no doubt that they will accept.
They are really very sensible and shrewd,
those fellows on the committee, eh, Burnham?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>“Remarkably,” replied the first superintendent.
“I didn’t know we had such intelligent
men.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But it is our business to know it,” Villard
returned, and Salome nodded her head. “We
laid our plans before them, and told them
that we would concede all their wishes, except
about the machinery of course. And one of
their own number spoke up promptly and said
it was hot-headed bigotry on their part that
had made them stick for the removal of the
frames. And that most of them, even the
Lancaster spinners, had come to see that every
improvement to the mills meant an improvement
of their condition. Then the secretary
wanted to know if they were to be allowed to
exist as a Union. Burnham told them that you
were taking a great interest in the management
of the mills; and that we all believe that no
harm can come of their organizing themselves
into an association, provided they were
willing to be reasonable, and to confer with us
before taking extreme measures again. He
begged them to believe that you are their
friend, and want them all to have a fair chance.
And he ended by assuring them that we, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>superintendents, fully concurred with you; and
that he hoped they would be willing to start on
a new basis, and to consider our interests as
they expect and desire us to remember theirs.
Burnham did himself proud, Miss Shepard, and
I could see they were a good deal affected by
his conduct.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am covered with blushes,” declared
Burnham. “Spare my modesty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Blushing must be a novel sensation to
you,” retorted Villard. “The leaders shook
hands with us when we came away and
thanked us for what we had said, assuring
us that they would be ready to enter the
mills again at once. And a different spirit
is evident to-night, all through the corporation.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t be too sanguine,” interrupted Burnham.
“We’re not through the woods yet.
And there are several ends to be achieved
before the millennium dawns.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should like,” said Salome, “if it will
not bore you too much, to outline the general
plan I have formed for raising the condition of
things at the mills.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nothing would give us greater pleasure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>than such a proof of your confidence,” replied
Burnham.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And we can assure you beforehand,” said
Villard, “of our hearty co-operation.”</p>

<p class='c008'>No one but Salome noticed that her aunt
had quietly slipped away when she spoke of
her plan. Mrs. Soule did not care to hear
Salome “talk shop.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“In the first place,” Salome began, “are
the mills all they should be? Are they well
lighted, aired and drained? Is the machinery
such as to benefit both the operators and the
business interests of the mills?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, they are not quite up to modern
standards,” Villard replied, promptly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know,” pursued Burnham, “but
they are quite as good as the average. There
are many worse mills than the Shawsheen.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That isn’t the point,” Salome replied.
“Are there any better? Or are they capable
of improvement?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, yes, if you don’t consider expense,”
assented Burnham.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are they well-lighted? Are their sanitary
conditions good?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They are very well-lighted indeed,” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Villard; “your grandfather built much in
advance of his time, and the mills are all light
and strong. But they need better ventilation
in cold weather; and, as you know, sanitary
science in Newbern Shepard’s day was hardly
up to modern demands.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I propose putting in the best drainage
system we can find. I propose bath-rooms,
wash-rooms and elevators.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good!” said both her superintendents.</p>

<p class='c008'>“As for machinery, you will know what is
needed there. We want the latest improved
methods of doing our work. It will not do
for us to be behind the times, or the world
will laugh at our philanthropic efforts. The
standard of the mills must be as high now as
it was in my grandfather’s day. Nothing but
the best of goods, made after the most approved
modern methods, must go out from us.
Otherwise the world will say we are visionary
and lack good business sense.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is true,” assented Burnham. “The
business must not suffer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“At the same time, I want the mills made so
pleasant and comfortable that our operatives
will prefer them to any other, knowing that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>we propose to consult their interests and happiness
in little things, as we desire that they
shall consult ours in great. Then their homes.
Those old rickety tenement houses must be
abolished from the face of the earth.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hear, hear,” cried Villard, “they have
long been an eyesore to me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They are a disgrace to us,” was Salome’s
emphatic answer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you can’t do that all at once,” said
Burnham. “That is something that will take
time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is April now,” said Salome. “I propose
to begin at once on new houses for the
operatives. They will have to stay where they
are for the summer, but by cold weather I
mean that every one of them shall be in new
quarters.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Whew!” said Burnham; “you <em>are</em> a
woman of business, Miss Shepard. But you
will have your hands full this year to build
new houses for two thousand people.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It can be done though,” Villard replied.
“There are plenty of carpenters and builders
to be had. What kind of tenements do you
propose?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>“I have not fully decided. At first I
thought of having single cottages for every
family, with a tiny plot of land for each. But
sometimes I wonder if some of the plans for
model tenement houses would not be more
feasible. What do you think?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There are advantages in both,” said Burnham.
“It is doubtful if many of the operatives
would appreciate a whole house, or take
good care of one. On the other hand, the best
tenement house system in the world has its
drawbacks.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“In a country-place where there is room
enough, as there is here,” advised Villard, “it
seems to me that the single cottage system is
the better. Each family can then have a
certain privacy, impossible to the tenement
house system. They can soon be educated up
to caring for their places, and, I think, will
soon come to take pride in them. They may
not pay, at first; but they will serve a higher
purpose. I have thought it would be a fine
thing,—in the Utopia of which I have often
dreamed,—if, connected with such a factory as
this, could be built some substantial, inexpensive
cottages which could be sold to the working-men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>with families, on very easy terms.
Let them occupy them as tenants, for instance,
until their rentals amount to a certain sum—say
two hundred dollars,—unless they have
been fortunate enough to have saved that
amount, which they can pay down, and then
let them take a deed of the place and give us
a mortgage. Pardon me, Miss Shepard, I am
only supposing a case.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And quite a supposable one,” said Salome,
her eyes glowing. “Why can’t it be done?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Doubtful if any of them would burden
themselves with a debt like that,” demurred
Burnham.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think they would,” Villard responded.
“The desire for a home of one’s own is an instinct
which is implanted in every human breast.
If the steadier, more sensible men of the mills
could be induced to try it, it would soon become
the ambition of all the younger ones to
own their homes. I am sure the overseers, at
least, would like to try it. So many of our
operatives live in a hand-to-mouth fashion,
never saving anything. Let them see that
what they pay for rent will be credited
to them; that they are actually saving that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>money, and they will, for the most part, gladly
fall in with the scheme. And when a man
begins to save up money, and to feel that he is
worth something, his self-respect increases and
ambition makes a man of him. I tell you, I
believe the thing could be done here, and the
condition of our working-men be vastly improved
by it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We will, at least, make the experiment,”
said Salome earnestly. “At first a wild dream
came to me of building model tenement houses
and practically giving them the rent. But I
soon came to see that it would be better for
them to pay what they could afford for improved
conditions.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That would be far wiser,” said Villard.
“To make them objects of charity would be to
lower their condition in the long run.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then I have a plan for the girls,” Salome
went on. “So many of them live in those
dreadful boardinghouses. I’ve been into one,
and I wonder how any girl can keep her self-respect
and live there. I am going to build a
large building, which shall have plenty of light,
airy bedrooms, prettily and inexpensively furnished;
so that a girl may feel that she has a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>cosy little spot somewhere on earth of her very
own. I am going to have model bath-rooms
and a large, cheerful dining-room. There will
be a matron to the establishment who will be
like a mother to the girls; not one who will
care nothing whether her girls are sober and
respectable, or miserable and besotted, so
long as they pay. This woman will win the
confidence of the girls, and lead them into
habits of personal cleanliness and common
sense; she will take an interest in their little
personal affairs, and advise them kindly and
judiciously. In short, she will make a home
for them in the truest sense of the word.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You will have to have her made to order,
Salome,” interrupted Marion from the sofa where
she had been an interested listener. “Such
paragons do not exist.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And would scarcely be appreciated by the
average factory girl if they did,” added Burnham,
smiling at Marion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shall have a large and pleasant parlor
with a piano and a comfortable reading-room,”
Salome continued, as though not hearing; “I
don’t suppose the girls, judging from what I
hear and see of them, will care much for reading
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>at first; but if I put plenty of light, healthful
literature in their way, with illustrated books
and good pictures on the walls, they will
gradually come to like them. And then, there
must be weekly entertainments, and perhaps a
hall.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And what about the young men?” inquired
Villard. “Are you going to leave our sex out
in the cold?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, if you educate the girls so much above
them, what are the young fellows to do?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They shall have such a boarding-house
too,” said Salome, “only we’ll call them
Unions. I hate the name boarding-house,
and I should think they would; and then, by
and by, there are still other schemes in my mind.
There are children, plenty of them, on the
corporation. They are poor, sickly, unkempt,
uncared-for. All this must be changed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That will come, I think,” said Burnham,
“with their improved conditions and surroundings.
It is unhealthful where they now are.
Shall you build the new houses there?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no, I forgot to say,” answered Salome,
“that we must put up their new quarters on
the hill, the other side of the mills. It is much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>pleasanter up there, and a far more healthful
locality. Work on them can begin right away.
Will you find me the proper man to undertake
the building of the houses, Mr. Villard?”</p>

<p class='c008'>John Villard’s heart fairly burned with enthusiasm.
This was a project he had long
cherished, although he had been entirely
without means or prospect of ever being able
to carry it out.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You may be sure I will do my best,” he
answered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And we will reserve the power of directing
and planning the buildings ourselves,” she added.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m glad you’re going to do something for
the children,” said Marion. “If you don’t
succeed in improving things in this generation
much, you will in the next, if you educate the
children.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is what I propose to do,” said Salome.
“They must have better schools than they ever
had.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And be compelled to attend them,” interposed
Burnham.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, there are so many things to be done. It
will take years to get everything in working
order.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>“You have laid out a beautiful scheme, Miss
Shepard,” remarked Geoffrey Burnham, “and
in most respects a practical one. But you
must not be too sanguine. These people are
ignorant,—fairly steeped in ignorance. They
are jealous, too, and doubtless will mistrust
your motives, and believe you have some selfish
reason behind all your endeavor.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have,” laughed Salome. “I want my
mills to be models, and my people to be the
best, most skilled, most intelligent, and most
progressive community in America.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bravo!” said Villard. “So do I.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am not so sanguine as you may think,”
Salome went on. “I know they are ignorant.
How should they be anything else? All their
lives they’ve been used as we use the machines
in the factory,—to make good cloth, and plenty
of money. Nobody has thought of their welfare,
or cared what they did, or thought, or
became, when working-hours were over. How
do we know what sort of men they are, or what
capabilities they possess? I read somewhere,
only the other day, that there may still be
Fichtes tending geese, and Robert Burns’ toiling
on the farm; that there may be, yet, successors
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>of William Dean Howells at the type-forms, of
T. B. Aldrich at the book-keeper’s desk, of
Mark Twain at the pilot-wheel. We have no
right to keep them back. But this writer went
on to say, that the world has less need of them,
even, than of those who cannot aspire to thrive
outside the shop, and who go to their daily toil
knowing that their highest hope must be not
to get ‘out of a job’ and not to have their
wages cut. I don’t suppose they will, at once,
appreciate our efforts to better their condition.
Possibly they will oppose us at first; but we
can have no better task to perform than to
make them prosperous, contented and joyous
in their work. And by making a man of the
operative, I fully believe we shall bring material
prosperity to the mills.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But the expense,” urged Burnham. “Have
you calculated that? I doubt if the mills could
stand so heavy a burden all at once.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have calculated the expense,” Salome
answered him. “And what cannot be done from
the yearly profits of the mills, I will do myself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We shall be eagerly watched by the whole
manufacturing world,” said Burnham.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So much the better,” added Villard. “It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>is time somebody set the example. If we
succeed in carrying out all these plans, and keep
the mills on a paying basis as well, it will be
the beginning of a mighty reform in the working-man’s
world. I believe we can succeed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You will be called quixotic and all sorts of
pleasant things, Salome,” said her friend Marion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The beginner in any reform is always
called a crank, if nothing worse,” replied
Salome. “If I chose to build a million-dollar
castle to live in myself; if I preferred to dress
in cloth of gold and silver; if I insisted upon
eating off solid gold dishes; or even if I were
to endow a church or a female college, the
world would admire and praise me, and say
these things are a rich woman’s prerogative.
If I choose instead to spend my fortune on the
Shawsheen Mills, and elevate by its judicious
expenditure two thousand operatives for whom
I ought to feel morally and socially responsible,
the world will probably wonder and call me
quixotic. Christ Himself was called a fanatic.
Most people to-day, if they voiced their real
sentiments, would wonder that He could be so
democratic as to die for the whole world, ignorant,
uncultivated, detestable sinners, and all.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>One of those silences fell upon the room,
that always follows the mention of Christ’s
name in a conversation not strictly “religious”
in character. Marion was admiring the courage
of her friend; Burnham was rather taken
aback at this fearless reference to a Being
whom he seldom heard mentioned outside the
churches; and Villard was surprised and delighted
with this unworldly woman of the world,
and her avowal of principles and hopes and
wishes which he had cherished for years. He
was the first to speak.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You must have done some hard thinking,—and
a good deal of reading, in the past six
months.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” answered Salome. “I have. I have
read everything I could think or hear of, on
subjects bearing on this case; and I have lain
awake many a night, since it was really borne in
upon me that I have something to do here, planning
my work. But the greater part of the
credit, if there is any, in my plans, lies with my
grandfather. He thought out many of these
things, years ago; I have simply adapted his
theories to our modern times and conditions.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>XI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>And so the great strike ended.</p>

<p class='c008'>Had Salome realized the burden of care
which she was taking upon herself, it is doubtful
whether she would have assumed it as
cheerfully as she did. But as weeks rolled
into months, and responsibilities multiplied
and cares increased until she became as hard a
worker as any in the mills, she did not flinch.
She had put her hand to the plough, and it
did not once occur to her to turn back.</p>

<p class='c008'>She went to the office of the mills the day
they were opened, and began to study, thoroughly,
the details of the business. Villard and
Burnham were her teachers, and both were
often astonished at her business keenness and
cool judgment. She had pressed Marion into
service immediately, and always took her to
the counting-room, where the two staid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>throughout the entire morning, going home to
lunch at two, and usually remaining there the
rest of the day. But always, whether she was
in the house, or out driving, or overseeing the
new houses, which were progressing rapidly,
Salome’s one thought was the improvement of
conditions at the Shawsheen Mills.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Marion had been with her a week,
Salome said to her:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Marion, I want you to stay with me all the
time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should be so glad,” replied her friend,
“but I can’t afford it. I shall have to go out
into the world again, before long, to earn my
living, dear; but I will stay here as long as I
can.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You good girl!” was Salome’s answer.
“Why not stay here and earn your living?
I want a companion, shall very soon need a
secretary, and as soon as I get things in running
order, ought to have a woman like you
to help draw in my people. You need a congenial
place at a comfortable salary. Now,
why not stay? I will pay you a thousand
dollars a year.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Marion drew a breath of astonishment.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>“It isn’t worth that,” she said; “Madame
Blanc only paid me seven hundred.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Madame Blanc is not fixing a scale of
wages for me,” said Salome; “as to your
‘worth,’ my dear, I must judge of that. When
we get fairly at work, I shall give you enough
to do, and you will find yourself a very busy
woman. Besides, if I had a young man to do
what I want you to do for me, he would ask a
thousand dollars, wouldn’t he? And why
shouldn’t you have it? Because you are a
woman?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Marion was not demonstrative. On the contrary,
she had a great deal of the true New
England reserve; but she got up and went over
to her friend, put both arms around her neck
and then——cried.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you could know what a chance this is
for me!” she said at last. “If you had known
what a dreary thing existence had become, and
what a hopeless prospect I had in the future!
And now, to live here and work with you,—in
your grand scheme,—Oh, Salome!” And she
wept again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then I will put the care of the cottages
into your hands first of all,” said Salome, patting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>her cheek. “You’ve kept house and know
what one ought to be like for an ordinary
family,—what things are necessary for the
comfort of the household and convenience of
the housewife. I don’t. I should be as apt
to build expensive music-rooms and leave
out the pantries, as any way. Go ahead, and
get up as nice houses as you can, at $1,500,
$2,000 and $2,500 a piece. Mr. Villard
thinks none of the employes will care to buy
anything more expensive. Here is the architect’s
address,” and she handed Marion a card.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the building of the model boarding-house
was a project too dear to Salome’s heart
for her to easily relinquish to others. Her
plan, as she had presented it to Villard and
Burnham, grew and magnified itself until her
co-laborers had to resort to all sorts of arguments
to keep her from wild extravagance.</p>

<p class='c008'>She had begun by planning for the factory girls
a house which should be really a home;
but as she went about among the operatives,
and began to get an inkling of what the young
men of the mills really were, of the bare, desolate
dens which gave them shelter, she did
not wonder that they resorted to the streets for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>comfort and amusement. She began to see how
the young men and girls who entered the mills
could scarcely help drifting into low and unworthy
lives; and she grew more determined
to do something to raise them to a higher
plane of living.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her grandfather’s manuscripts did not help
her much here. In Newbern Shepard’s day,
the factory-hand had not sunk to such ignorance
or even degradation, as he has, in some
instances, in later times; and in those more
democratic times, it had not been so hard for
him to rise above the level of his kind. In
that day, too, it had been possible for him to
find a home, in the true sense of the word,
with families of a certain degree of refinement.
But in Salome’s more modern times, she saw,
and grieved, that the factory boarding-places
were of the sort that dragged the operatives
down and kept them on a lower plane, even,
than the Shawsheen tenement system.</p>

<p class='c008'>She consulted much with the superintendents
and with Marion. She visited the large
cities and thoroughly examined the young
men’s and young women’s various houses and
unions. She got ideas from all, but a perfected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>plan from none. Finally, she collaborated
with her architect, Robert Fales, and soon had
her model boarding-house on paper. After
that it was only a work of days to begin on
the foundations of the institution.</p>

<p class='c008'>The operatives at the Shawsheen Mills gazed
on all these changes with curious interest,
which, however, they carefully suppressed when
any of their superiors were about. The average
independent American citizen, as he exists
among working-men, does not care to pose as
an object of even partial charity. He delights
in crying out against Capital, and clamoring for
a share of the Profits; but when it comes to
actual taking of what he does not feel he has
earned, he is more backward.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Shawsheen operatives, in spite of the
promises which had been made, had gone to
work again with little hope that the state of
affairs for them would be any better in future
than in the past. As days went by, and they
saw Salome Shepard come to the mills every
morning, and knew that she was personally interested
in them as her people, they were skeptical
of any results for good. And when they began
to hear it whispered that she, a woman, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>the actual head of the Shawsheen Mills, some
of them talked earnestly of leaving. What!
they—strong, able-bodied, skilled mechanics—work
under a woman?</p>

<p class='c008'>But they didn’t go. A dull season was upon
them, and work scarce. Other mills were shutting
down and sending their operatives into
two months of enforced idleness. The Shawsheen
hands were forced to stay where they
were and be thankful for a chance to work.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then, as the story that they were to be
furnished with new and better homes gained
credence among them, their first real interest
dawned. Many did not believe their conditions
would be bettered; many, even, did not
care; and most of them grumbled because
their rents would probably be high, and said
the new buildings were only a means to grind
the poor and extort more money from them, to
put into a rich woman’s pocket. Such is the
thankless task of the philanthropist.</p>

<p class='c008'>Salome heard something of this, but did not
allow the knowledge to disquiet her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A few months will convince them,” she
said, quietly. “No wonder they are on the
lookout for oppression and extortion. As near
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>as I can judge, this factory has long been run
on a plan to warrant them in such a belief.”
And this was all she ever said against Otis
Greenough’s method of administering affairs
at the mills.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the summer went by, Salome’s friends in
the town began to wonder at her extravagant
outlay, as they called it. They prophesied that
she would soon tire of her new amusement, and
leave the houses unfinished, when her projects
would fall flat. Some of them came to her and
remonstrated, on the ground that her inexperience
in financial affairs was cause enough for
her leaving the Shawsheen Mills and the
employes as they had been. But invariably
she replied, that if she had chosen to build
herself a million-dollar castle, they would have
approved of her; but because she proposed
to spend a half-million on the mill property,
all of which she felt sure would return to her
some day with interest, she was called extravagant
and foolish.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But if you had built the million-dollar
house,” said Mrs. Greenough, “it would have
been a great thing for the place. Think what
an ornament to Shepardtown it would be!”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>“And think what an improvement—what a
great thing for Shepardtown—it will be to
tear away those miserable, tumble-down tenements
on Shawsheen alley, and to add a hundred
neat and cosy houses to the hill,” she
retorted. “And, besides, you haven’t seen my—well,
my Institution (I haven’t named it
yet). Think what an ornament that will be
to the place.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But as nobody realized what the “Institution”
of her dreams was to be, Salome got no
sympathy from her friends. Curiosity increased
on all hands, as the summer waned and an
immense brick structure grew apace on the hill.
It had a square, dome-like center, with huge
wings on each side. But the workmen were
sworn to secrecy, and nobody was allowed to go
inside from the time the building was far
enough advanced to allow of its entrances being
fastened up.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>XII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It was finished at last. The plasterers and
painters and plumbers had done their last
stroke of work and departed, leaving the keys
with Salome, as she had requested. On the
same afternoon, she sent for Robert Fales, and
together they showed Burnham and Villard,
with Marion Shaw and Mrs. Soule—who was
as anxious as any of them to see the place,
although she would not own it—over the new
building.</p>

<p class='c008'>A broad flight of stone steps led up to the
main entrance. The wooden framework, which
had concealed the façade, had been taken down,
and there, over the massive doorway, was the
name of Salome’s “Institution,” carved in red
sandstone—“<span class='sc'>Newbern Shepard Hall</span>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why not simply Shepard Hall?” said
Burnham, as they stood looking up at it.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>“Or Salome Shepard Hall?” put in Mrs.
Soule’s voice, for she felt that it would be like
the rest of her niece’s folly to have her name
carved in stone up there.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Auntie!” exclaimed Salome reprovingly;
then, turning to Geoffrey Burnham—“Shepard
Hall might have meant me, or it might have
meant my father, or the whole race of us in
general. This building is a memorial to Newbern
Shepard, not to his family. How do you
like the design of the façade?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The building was of red brick, with massive
trimmings of red sandstone, and was substantial
and useful in general appearance, rather
than ornate.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ten times as expensive as you needed,”
was her aunt’s comment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” answered Burnham, to whom the remark
was directed. “A cheap, wooden building
would have answered the purpose, I should say.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps,” laughed Salome; “but I am not
putting up wooden monuments to my grandfather’s
memory. Besides, you don’t know my
purpose, yet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Something quixotic and unnecessary, I’m
afraid, my dear,” answered Mrs. Soule.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>Salome did not answer but led the way up
the stairway, and unlocked the heavy doors
These opened into a vestibule leading into a
large room fitted up with bookcases and
tables.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is the library,” said she. “Now, see
the two reading-rooms, one on each side. One
is for the girls, and one for the young men.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They passed out into the one designed for
the girls,—a pleasant airy room with plenty of
light and space. The walls were tinted and
the woodwork was in the natural finish. Nothing
in the way of furnishing had, of course,
been done. Beyond the reading-room was another
large class-room, and opening from it
were several smaller ones. These all occupied
one wing of the new building.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you propose to have done with
all these rooms?” asked some one.</p>

<p class='c008'>Salome looked over to John Villard and
smiled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve read and studied ‘All Sorts and Conditions
of Men’ to some purpose,” she said;
“I propose, as time goes on, to have various
practical and useful things taught the girls
here. Dressmaking for instance, and millinery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>and domestic science. The conveniences for
that, though, are in the basement.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She led the way by a flight of stairs that led
from a side-entrance, at the end of the wing, to
the basement. There was a spacious hall with
rows of hooks to hang garments on. From
this, opened a large and pleasant dining-room.
Under the main portion of the building was a
great kitchen with ranges and all the modern
appliances of a hotel kitchen, though on a
smaller scale.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Isn’t this rather elaborate for a factory
boarding-house?” asked Burnham; “for, I
take it, that is one of your objects, at least, if
not the primary one.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I approve of this,” said Mrs. Soule judicially.
“It’s poor policy to fit out a kitchen
with cheap stuff. Give servants the best of
everything to do with, and teach them how to
take care of them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Miss Shepard has gone over the subject
very carefully,” said Mr. Fales, “and, I must
say, has shown most excellent judgment in
everything. As you say, madam, it’s only
money wasted to put cheap stuff into a building
like this.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>“Now, look through the pantries and larder
and laundry,” Salome interrupted; “I think,
for a woman who knows absolutely nothing of
the details of housekeeping, I’ve excelled myself.”
She spoke boastfully and shook her head
at Marion, at the close of her speech.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How much of it did Miss Shaw plan?”
slyly asked Geoffrey Burnham.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Every bit of it, below the main floor,”
responded Salome. “Since you seem incapable
of believing that I did it, I may as well
own that Marion and Mr. Fales planned the
whole of the basement, and that I, in my ignorance,
could only look on and admire. But
they did so well that now I am inclined to take
all the glory to myself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They passed through the basement, coming
up at the other end of the building, and found
themselves in the young men’s wing. Here,
besides the reading-rooms and class-room,
was another fitted with two or three workbenches.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I propose to give them a chance to take
an industrial education,” said Salome, “if they
should want it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I declare!” ejaculated Mrs. Soule. “To
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>give skilled mechanics a chance to take lessons
at the work-bench! You are out of your mind,
child.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I didn’t plan it for skilled mechanics,
auntie,” said Salome gently, “although they
may come if they want to. But you know,
or ought to, that the majority of our men can
only perform one kind of work. They may be
nearly perfect in their special branch, but are
almost helpless when it comes to handling the
hammer and saw and chisel. If they learn the
proper use of these things, it will not only increase
their knowledge in that direction, it will
broaden them in other ways.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t see how,” persisted her aunt.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Besides,” put in John Villard, “if it does
no other good, if the experiment keeps a few
of our fellows off the street at night and
develops a new taste, it will be worth while.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, perhaps you are right,” said Mrs.
Soule, “but no such philosophy or philanthropy
was taught in my day.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘The world do move,’ auntie,” laughed
Salome. “Now, shall we go upstairs?”</p>

<p class='c008'>A broad flight of steps from the hallway at
the end of the wing led up to the second floor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>which was just like the one on the girls’ wing.
Upstairs, the broad corridor ran through the
middle of the wing, with bedrooms opening
from either side. In the main body of the
building, under the dome, was a large hall,
fitted up with movable seats, and having a
raised platform at the front.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is the pride of my heart,” Salome
announced, as she ushered her friends into it.
“If any one dares to criticise it, woe be unto
him! Mr. Burnham, what fault can you find
with this?”</p>

<p class='c008'>They all laughed at her inconsistency.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should not dare make it known, if I had
any,” he said. “But may I ask what it is
for?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, to hold meetings in, and lectures and
things,” she answered, quickly; “what did you
suppose?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! And for the Labor Unions to congregate
in and plan how they may overthrow
and destroy you, I suppose,” scoffed Burnham.
“And it is a capital place to breed the
next strike.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There will be no ‘next strike,’” was the
confident answer. “And as for the rest, wait
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>and see. I had the seats all movable because
once in a while there will be a party, and they
will want the floor for dancing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Salome! Not dancing?” cried her aunt.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why not? The floor is an excellent
one for dancing. I saw to that myself,”
said she, purposely misunderstanding her relative.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are not going to let them have their
low dances here?” Mrs. Soule’s tone showed
how much the idea horrified her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Low dances? Certainly not,” said her
niece. “But we are going to show them how
to have something better. We are going to
lift them above wanting a low entertainment of
any kind, and teach them how such things
are carried on by better people,—by us, for
example.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Salome, you don’t mean me to understand
that you are going to come and dance here,
yourself?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps, though I had not thought of it.
But why not?” continued the perverse niece.
“Mr. Villard, will you lead the first figure with
me, on our opening night?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“With the greatest pleasure in the world,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>said he, with a thrill at his heart which he did
not recognize.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Soule sat down on a convenient window-seat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What would your father say?” she murmured.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I never knew my father well enough to
judge.” Salome answered, with a slight tinge
of bitterness in her tone. “But I know what
my grandfather would say. I am going to put
a piano in here,—or would you have an organ?—and
I intend that this hall shall be the rallying
place of the young people. I’m also going
to give a course of entertainments here during
the winter, twice a week; I’m not going to begin
with lectures and heavy ‘intellectual treats;’
but I will gradually lead up to them with concerts
and even a minstrel show or two.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Salome,” gasped her aunt feebly from the
window-sill.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You see, if we begin by shooting over their
heads, they won’t come at all,” said Salome.
“But if we begin with something light and
amusing, and not too far above their level, and
gradually raise the tone of the entertainments,
they’ll find themselves attending lectures and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>other sugar-coated forms of intellectual betterment,
and like them; and never mistrust that I
am working out a mission on their unsuspecting
heads.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m glad you realize something of their
present intellectual condition,” said John Villard,
who had been unusually silent and grave
while looking over the new building; “and
realize that it’s only gradually that we can
bring them, as a class, up to a higher grade as
intelligent young people.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I do,” said Salome, “I’ve seen too much
of them, myself, this summer. At first, I was
appalled by the absolute lack of common knowledge
among the average girls. But there are
a few, I know, who have already improved the
slight advantages they’ve had; and these few
I shall rely on to help me by their influence in
raising the rest; the ‘little leaven,’ you know.
It seems to me, that only by raising the intellectual
condition, and the educational aspiration,
can we hope to accomplish anything of
permanent value to the mills.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is the only way,” was Villard’s
response. “And, Miss Shepard,” he said,
hurriedly, for the others had already scattered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>through the girls’ wing, leaving them alone,
“I want to say that, as I believe you have
found the only true solution to the main questions
of the labor problem, I pledge myself to
heartily sustain you in every way. You have
only to command me, and I am ready.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Why did Salome turn away to hide the vivid
blush that suddenly swept over her face?</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am sure of that,” she said, presently, with
an effort, “I have counted on you from the
first. I shall try, by my own personal efforts,
to help the factory girls. But I shall depend
on you, and you alone, to manage the young
men.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shall not fail you,” was all he said, as
Salome locked the door of the hall behind them,
and they went over the girl’s wing to find the
others.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bedrooms on this wing were like those
on the other side. There were ample closets
and plenty of light and air and window space.
The rooms were not spacious, but they were
complete in every respect, and a vast improvement
on anything the Shawsheen mill-girls had
ever seen.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I did not want large rooms,” said Salome;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>“I think it is better to put not more than two
girls in a room. I shall put two single beds in
each, and fit up the rooms with everything
necessary for comfort; then I shall insist that
the girls keep their own rooms in the best of
order. Oh, you’ll see what a disciplinarian I
shall be!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The third floor was entirely given up to bedrooms,
the two wings being entirely separated
from each other by the upper portion of the
hall which extended to the top of the dome.
Every part of the building was beautifully
finished, well-lighted, and planned for general,
practical convenience.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There, if I never do anything else,” said
Salome, after they had come out of the place,
and stood looking back at it, “I shall feel
that I have raised a suitable monument to old
Newbern Shepard. I believe, if he could have
lived until now, that he would have done the
same thing himself—only better.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He couldn’t, Miss Shepard,” said Villard.
“It is absolutely perfect.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” admitted Burnham, “it is. But do
you realize, Miss Shepard, what an elephant
you’ve got on your hands? It’s going to be a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>fearful tax on your mind and strength to keep
it up, and to carry out half you’ve planned.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, what were health and strength given
me for?” Salome asked, with the abruptness
which sometimes characterized her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Most young women find a solution to that
question without running an eleemosynary institution,”
was Burnham’s mental comment;
but he said nothing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I expect to see my happiest days while I
have the care of this establishment. I’m sure
I never was so happy as I’ve been for the past
six months. Now, I must finish this great
house. I shall need all the suggestions and
practical aid you can each give me, especially
about the libraries and reading-rooms. As to
the selection of books, I’m going to begin with
a comparative few. Will you two gentlemen
come up to the house to-morrow night, prepared
to help make out a suitable list?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You forget that I have to go to New York
to-morrow,” said Burnham. “But Villard can
go; and I can help afterwards, you know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“As soon as we get everything in readiness,”
pursued Salome, “we will have a formal opening.
We’ll have music and something good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>to eat, and a little talking, and perhaps a dance
to close with.” Salome looked wickedly at
her aunt, but the latter paid no heed. “Remember
your promise, Mr. Villard.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shall not be the one to forget it,” he
answered.</p>

<p class='c008'>They separated very soon, Salome and her
aunt and Marion taking the architect home
with them, and Burnham and Villard going
back to the mills.</p>

<p class='c008'>But all through the afternoon, and all
through the watches of the night, one sentence
repeated itself to John Villard’s heart, comforting
and helping him, strangely: “I have
counted on you from the first.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>XIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It was Halloween when the new building
was formally opened. Up to that time, only a
few privileged persons were allowed to enter
its sacred portals; but every one connected
with the Shawsheen Mills was invited to be
present at the opening.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the hill, back of the mills, stood one
hundred new cottages, each costing from
fifteen to twenty-five hundred dollars, and all
ready for occupancy; but as yet none of the
mill-hands had seen the inside of one of them.</p>

<p class='c008'>It had been a work of no small magnitude
to find a suitable matron for the Newbern
Shepard Hall. But, finally, the widow of a
former physician in Shepardtown, a woman of
excellent character and judgment, and with
some experience as matron of a young ladies’
school, was secured and duly installed in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>two pleasant rooms set apart for her in the
girls’ wing.</p>

<p class='c008'>John Villard had relieved Salome’s mind of
another perplexity, by offering to take up permanent
quarters for himself in the young
men’s side; for, although she had felt the
necessity of such an arrangement, she had not
liked to ask him to give up what she rightly
guessed were more congenial apartments in a
quiet corner of the town. But he felt that his
influence would be needed at the Hall, and
that he could do the work which he hoped to
do much better, if he were in the midst of the
young men whom he wished to interest in
many ways. And before Halloween, he was
comfortably settled in two rooms at the Hall.</p>

<p class='c008'>The evening came, clear and cold; such an
evening as only the last of October can give.
The building was brilliantly lighted from top
to bottom, and decorated with flags and evergreen.
Outside, Chinese lanterns and bunting
lined both sides of the walk up to the main
entrance, and helped to give it a holiday air. A
band of street-musicians, who happened to be
in town, had been engaged and were stationed
in front of the building, where their tolerably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>harmonious strains gave just as much pleasure
to the not over-critical audience that was fast
assembling, as Thomas’ or Seidl’s men could
have afforded them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Inside, Salome waited impatiently. Without
any premeditated plan, Villard and Burnham
placed her and Marion, with Mrs. Soule
in the background—for she “declined to be
introduced to these persons”—in the center of
the library; and forming themselves into a
reception committee, they drafted into service
a few of the best-appearing young men, who
presented every comer to the owner of the
mills and her friend. After giving each one a
cordial welcome and hand-shake, Salome told
them they were free to inspect the new building
as they pleased; and, consequently, every
mill-hand, accompanied by every other member
of his or her family, went critically over the
wonderful new building, which seemed to their
unaccustomed eyes a structure of unwonted
magnificence, and furnished in a most luxurious
style.</p>

<p class='c008'>It had been fitted up inexpensively, but with
the utmost good taste. No carpets were on
the floors, but American rugs abounded wherever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>they had seemed necessary. The library
furniture was of plain, substantial oak, like the
heavy woodwork of the room. Throughout
the rest of the house, bedrooms, dining-rooms,
and class-rooms were furnished with strong,
neat, ash furniture. There were a few good
engravings on the walls of the principal rooms,
and the bookcases were about half-filled with
literature of a harmless and interesting, if light
quality. They had all agreed it would not be
best to fill the shelves at first, but to watch the
popular taste and to “leave room for improvement,”
as Marion said.</p>

<p class='c008'>The operatives were simply astonished at
what they saw. Some were even yet incredulous,
and whispered that they would not be willing
nor able to live in such a place; but many
of the girls’ eyes brightened as they inspected
their new quarters, and showed a determination,
on the part of their owners, to come in for some
of the good times they saw in store. It is doubtful
if even the lowest ones there did not feel a
new self-respect creeping up in their hearts.
Dress may not make the man, but surroundings
often do the woman.</p>

<p class='c008'>By half-past eight the stream of people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>stopped pouring through the big front doors.
Everybody had come in, shaken hands with
Salome and Marion, and passed along, scattering
themselves over the building.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now let’s get every one into the hall,
above,” said Salome, “and have a little talking
and some music.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was some little time before the crowd of
visitors could be gathered in one place, but
after a while the hall was well filled, and the
musicians installed in their place. The sound
of the band, indoors, proved an effectual summons
for the stragglers. For the first time,
Salome, on the platform, faced a surging, eager
crowd of her own people in Newbern Shepard
Hall.</p>

<p class='c008'>She had wanted one of her two “faithful
henchmen” to take the lead to-night; but
they had each refused, saying she was better
fitted than they; that it was eminently her own
affair and not theirs, and that the success of
the opening depended on her alone. The
last argument was enough, and, much to
Mrs. Soule’s horror at seeing “Cora de Bourdillon’s
daughter” in such a plight, Salome
presided over her first meeting,—“exactly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>as if she were one of those ‘woman’s rights
women.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>When the musicians had finished, Salome
stepped forward, and not without some inward
quaking, made her first speech.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was an occasion the Shawsheen Mill hands
never forgot. Salome, always well and appropriately
dressed, had not slighted them by refusing
to appear at her best. She wore a white
China silk costume, rightly thinking her young
people would be readily reached by the gospel
of good clothes. Her gown was simply
made, but fitted exquisitely her well-proportioned
figure. Neck and wrists were finished
with beautiful old point lace, and she did not
scorn to wear her grandmother’s diamonds.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her attractive appearance, her cordial
and interested manner, and her winning
voice had pleaded her cause with the critical
operatives before she had uttered a half-dozen
sentences. Her sincerity and earnestness went
straight to their sensibilities, and, before she
had suspected it, every heart in the room was
hers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My dear friends,” she began, “I
never made a speech in my life, and cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>now. I never stood on a platform before; and
only my interest in every one of you brings me
here to-night. I only want to say that this
building, which you see now for the first time,
and which I hope will prove a happy home for
many of you, is built to my grandfather’s
memory. Some who are present to-night remember
him and love him still, I hope.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Here several gray-haired men in the audience
nodded their heads, and one was heard to mutter,
“Ay, ay, we do.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If he had lived, I think everything
in the factory would have been different.
Your lives would have been different; and mine,
too, perhaps. For one thing, I don’t believe
you and I would have grown up strangers to
each other. You know, by this time, I am sure,
that I have a glorious plan for making the
Shawsheen Mills the best on earth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not by tearing down mills and building
new and more elegant ones; not alone by making
costly improvements; but by having—and
mind, this is the only way it can be done,—by
having the best and most conscientious and intelligent
class of operatives in this country,—and
that will mean, of course, in the world.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>Now, you all know I cannot do this alone;
every one of you has a part in carrying out
this plan of mine. And unless you all agree
to help, it will fail. Don’t think I want you to
do any impossible thing. I only want every
one of you to be the best and do the best you
possibly can. You and I are going to have
some splendid times in the future. We’re
going to get better acquainted with each other.
We are going to become real friends. On your
part, you are going to deserve my good opinion
and my honest friendship; on my part, I’m
going to deserve your confidence and trust and
love; and between us we are going to show
the people of Massachusetts that a cotton-factory
can become something more than a
great machine to grind out yards and yards of
unbleached sheeting; and that its operatives
can become something better and greater than
so many smaller wheels in the machinery. We
will show that a factory community may be, and
is, a prosperous, happy, contented and intelligent
people.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Some of the young men could contain themselves
no longer, and broke into enthusiastic
applause as Salome uttered the last sentiment.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>Villard chuckled secretly as he observed that
the leaders in it were the heads of the committees
in the recent strike.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m so glad you agree with me,” said
Salome heartily, when the noise had subsided.
“Now, I want to tell you about this house.
The rooms are all ready for occupancy. I think
there are accommodations for all who care to
come. You are to leave the old boardinghouses
on the corporation, and I shall have them
taken down at once. The price of board will
remain the same as at the old houses. The
reading-rooms are ready, the library is yours,
and we shall soon find means of entertainment
and work, which will keep us all contented, I
hope. Mr. Villard will occupy rooms on this
floor, and the matron, whom I will shortly present
to you, will be on the girls’ wing. There
will be but few rules, and those, I trust, not
irksome. I cannot imagine that any one will
not be willing to obey them. The new houses
on the hill are all ready for the families on the
corporation to move into. A few of the larger
and better houses are to be let at an increased
rental; but most of them will be let at the
old rates. We have a plan, by which any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>one who wants to, may, after a little, buy a house
and pay for it by monthly installments, just
the same as you pay rent. But I will not go
into details. Mr. Fales will be at the first cottage
on the hill, and you can all make arrangements
with him at any time after to-morrow
morning. Now I have talked too long, I know,
and am going to stop. I want to have you
hear what Mr. Burnham and Mr. Villard have
to say; but first we must have some music.”</p>

<p class='c008'>If Salome could have read the trembling
waves of sympathy and reverence which were
already vibrating from the hearts of the young
people whom she had addressed, she would not
have sat down with the feeling of self-distrust
and failure which followed her speech. The
experience, the very atmosphere, was unique in
the history of industrial experiments.</p>

<p class='c008'>The two superintendents followed the band
with speeches that were characteristic of each.
Burnham’s, witty and tinged with sarcasm, but
friendly and cordial enough; and Villard’s,
strong with earnest purpose and full of brotherly
love. The matron, Mrs. French, was presented,
also, and her few remarks won a
friendly recognition among the young folks;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>and then Salome announced that the meeting
would adjourn to the dining-rooms in the
basement.</p>

<p class='c008'>More refined audiences than hers have not
been slow to exchange an atmosphere of sentiment
and intellectuality for one of prosaic
salads and cold meats, and more fanciful ices
and coffee; and the Shawsheen operatives were
soon encountering a more æsthetic collation,
it is probable, than had ever been served them
before. But as it was a bountiful one, they
acted well their part and found no fault.</p>

<p class='c008'>The crowning delight of the evening came
afterward. The young men were asked to
lend a hand, and soon the floor was cleared
in the large hall, and word was circulated
through the house that the evening’s entertainment
would close with dancing. Nothing
could have gone so far toward convincing
the mill-hands that Salome had meant what
she said, than this concession to their social
rights, unless it was the fact that she, herself,—the
haughty, aristocratic daughter of Floyd
Shepard, whom they had looked upon with
envy not unmixed with hatred,—that she should
lead the dance with the younger superintendent.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>An orchestra of three pieces was selected
from the band of musicians, and Marion and
Salome, by turns, furnished the piano accompaniment.
Salome claimed her promise from
Villard and danced merrily, not only the first
figure but several others. Mrs. Soule was too
much overcome by all she had seen and heard
to endure this, and was taken home; but the
others staid until the midnight hour tolled, and
the dancers had all bidden good-night to their
newly-developed friends and gone home enthusiastic
in their praise of the new order of
things in the mill <i><span lang="fr">régime</span></i>, and, especially, of
the woman who was opening to them the wider
doors of opportunity.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>XIV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>John Villard passed a wakeful night in
his new rooms at Newbern Shepard Hall. A
strange and unwonted feeling had taken possession
of him; one which he was slow to
recognize, but which cried loudly to him of
his folly and presumption, even while it refused
to be put off.</p>

<p class='c008'>After that first dance, Salome had paused by
an open window and he had stood idly watching
her. Suddenly a tremendous desire to
clasp her in his arms, to hold her close, to
demand her full surrender, swept over him. So
sudden and strong was the passion, that it was
with difficulty that he kept from seizing the
soft hand which lay dangerously near on the
window-sill. So over-mastering was it, that he
dared not stay or even speak. He turned on
his heel and went out under the quiet stars,
alone.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>In the days when she had held aloof from
the mill, and the superintendents scarcely ever
saw her, Geoffrey Burnham had regarded her
as “something too bright and good for human
nature’s daily food,” looking upon her as immensely
above him, socially speaking. But
now that she had become familiarly associated
with them in the daily affairs and interests of
the mill, Burnham thought of her as having
entered the field of good comradeship, and
felt that friendly, if not exactly equal, terms
existed between them.</p>

<p class='c008'>With John Villard it was different. He had
begun by looking with a certain degree of
scorn upon a woman who held tremendous interests
so lightly as she had done in the old
days. He had felt for her all the contempt a
man who does not know them—a man with
serious purposes—may feel for the irresponsible
butterflies he imagines society-girls to be. With
her deeper interest in the side of life which
interested him, and her efforts to raise the
standard of the mills, her realization of what
to him was a sacred object in life and her devotion
to it, his thought of her had changed.</p>

<p class='c008'>With him, familiar every-day contact had not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>made of her a comrade, in the ordinary sense
of the word. Her beauty and refinement, together
with the consciousness which never left
his sensitive soul, that it was her wealth and
her generosity which made the new conditions
possible,—these things only served to raise her
to a pedestal where she stood, forever apart
from the rest of the universe,—a woman to be
revered and worshiped; not a woman to be
aspired to.</p>

<p class='c008'>Suddenly, he found himself in love with her.
The tide of feeling which swept over him was
one that no man could mistake. It was not
enough that he might worship her on her
pedestal, with a devotion silent and unknown.
He wanted to hold her in his arms. He wanted
her eyes to droop before his glance—not to
look at him in the steady fashion he knew so
well. He wanted to feel her heart beating
against his. He wanted to kiss her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Poor fool!” he told himself, a hundred
times that night. “As if she would even look
at me—a poor factory-boy, self-educated, self-trained,
and—yes, self-conceited!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He remembered his youth; how poor he had
been; how he had studied by moonlight to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>save the expense of a candle; how he had
worked all through his boyhood in a cotton-mill,
that he might help his older sister to support
their mother; how, after his mother had
died and his sister married, he had remained
poor and alone and almost friendless; how
little he had seen and known of women; how
utterly lacking he was in all the graces of society
and the refinements that he supposed to
come from outward polish only; in short, how
utterly at variance with her tastes and interests
and aims his life had been.</p>

<p class='c008'>He remembered her life of luxury, of travel,
of careful training, and the indulgence of
cultivated, æsthetic tastes. What was he, that
he should dare to even think of her? What
but a presumptuous fool, that he should dream
of touching even her frail, white hand? And
yet, her eyes had drooped when they met his
that day, when they all went over the Hall
together. Stay—what did it mean? Did she?—could
she feel?—but, no. He was a presumptuous
idiot to think of it.</p>

<p class='c008'>He paced the floor for an hour. Then he
lit a cigar and, under its peaceful influences, he
tried again to fix his mind on the mills, on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>changed condition of things, on anything,—but
her. Still, constantly, over and over, her
tall, white-robed figure took shape in the curling
wreaths of vapor, and he fell to dreaming
what it would be like to have a happy home of
his own, with her as its center and joy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again, he was exasperated with himself and
called himself hard names. He threw away the
half-smoked weed and resolutely prepared for
bed; but only to toss wearily about, combating
himself on the old grounds until the dawn,
pushing its way through the crevices of his
blinds, told him to rise and set his face again
toward the workaday world. It was the first
time that hard-working, earnest, practical John
Villard had ever passed a sleepless night.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had hardly seen how he was to bear the
daily contact with Salome, after that. He was
too modest and too honest with himself to
dream that there might be any hope for him.
He had, at one time during the night, thought
of leaving the mills, and going away to try a
new and easier life than this promised to be.
Then he called himself a coward and remembered
her words:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have depended on you from the first,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>and he determined to stay, cost what it might.
Besides, all his hopes and interests were with
the Shawsheen workers. No: he could not
leave them, he could not leave her now.</p>

<p class='c008'>So he went forth in the morning, unchanged
in outward appearance, and yet, stronger and
better for this first grand fight with himself.
And he met her with his usual deferential bow
and smile when, by and by, she came to the
office for her usual morning’s study of business
affairs.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was unanimously agreed that the opening
of the Hall had been a grand success. The
mill-hands, themselves, seemed to feel the new
attitude into which they had suddenly stepped,
and were already brighter and more hopeful.</p>

<p class='c008'>On her way to the mills, Salome had met a
young overseer, who was hurrying in to town
for something. She greeted him pleasantly,
calling him by name, when, to her surprise, he
stopped.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d like to thank you, Miss Shepard,” the
burly young fellow began, “for what you are
doing for us. If all the employers took the
interest in their operatives as you do in us,
we’d want no more Unions, and there’d be no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>more strikes. I’m thinking you’ve got ahead
of the rest of us on the labor question, and
found the right answer to it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m very glad to hear you say that,”
Salome answered, with a glow at her heart
which no speech from a man of the world had
ever produced. “I want to find it, if I haven’t
yet. But, you know it doesn’t depend on
me alone. I may try, as hard as I can, but if
you people don’t co-operate with me, I’m helpless.
I want to depend on you, Mr. Brady.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And you can that, miss,” was the hearty
answer. “You’ve got us all on your side now,
sure. I went up this morning to see the houses.
They are fine ones, too.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And did you pick out one for yourself, Mr.
Brady? You are married, I believe?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am that; and I’ve got as good a wife as
ever the saints sent to bless a man. Yes, I
picked out the one I liked best; but the
woman’ll have to see it first, you know. And
then, do you know, I think I’ll buy it. The
terms are so easy, and I’ve a little money laid
by, that I’d like to use; and I’m thinking
Carrie’d be happier in a home of our own.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, that’s sensible of you,” said Salome,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>delighted that her houses were in such good
prospect of pleasing. “If you do it, I’ve no
doubt a good many others will. And, by and
by, we shall have quite a community of property
owners.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Brady straightened himself up unconsciously
at the word, touched his hat and passed on,
his heart warmed and gratified by the kindly
notice; while Salome entered the office in
unusually good spirits.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It seems to me,” she began, addressing herself
to Burnham, “that everything is swinging
round into the circle of my plans far better
than I had dared hope. I expected opposition,
or at least indifference, on the part of the
operatives. On the contrary, they are all as
delighted with the state of affairs as I am.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why shouldn’t they be?” was Burnham’s
comment. “They’d be ungrateful wretches
if they weren’t. They’ve far more to gain
than you have to lose, remember.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you’ve been trying to make me believe,”
pursued Salome, “that they didn’t want their
condition improved; that they were satisfied to
be let alone; and that they’d resist every improvement
I offered.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>“Wait a little and see;” Burnham tried to
make his tone impartial, if not skeptical;
“you’ve only begun yet. Don’t expect the
habits of months and years, the loose customs
and low tastes, are going to be overthrown in
a single night. The affair of last night, for
instance, was doubtless the most orderly entertainment
and the quietest dance they ever had.
But it don’t follow that they will all of them be
satisfied to drop entirely the old order of low
dances when they had plenty to drink, even if
they didn’t have salads and coffee, or ice-cream
and cake. There’s no telling how many of
them will be stealing off to those places before
winter is over.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then we must get up some form of
entertainment that will hold them to us,”
said Salome firmly. “They sha’n’t fall
back, if anything we can compass can save
them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Villard looked across his big ledger at her,
as if she had been an angel sent from Heaven
direct, to preach a higher political economy to
the cotton factories of earth. She caught his
look and smiled back at him; but she said no
more.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>She did not speak to him until just as she
was ready to go home.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How do you like your new quarters, Mr.
Villard?” she said, then. “I hope you rested
well last night?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Villard remembered his sleepless hours
vaguely, as in a dream. She looked so bright
and untroubled herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You deserted me after that first dance.
Did I dance so badly that you feared or dreaded
to be caught by me again? If it hadn’t been
for Mr. Burnham and Mr. Fales I should have
felt quite a wall-flower.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You never could be that, Miss Shepard,”
poor Villard managed to say.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, as soon as the young people get moved
in we must start some classes. I know a good
dressmaker whom I can get, and Marion will
teach them some other things, if they want it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She lingered some minutes, talking over the
Hall and her plans, and left him with a confused
image of herself mixing up with the
figures of the ledger in a most incongruous way.
Alas! John Villard was to have many a hard
fight with himself before he could drive away
that image at will.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>The young operatives—and all that dwelt
within the corporation boarding-house walls—began
that very night to pick up their effects,
and make ready to move into their new quarters.
Mrs. French had all she could attend to in preparing
for her large family, assigning rooms, and
attending to the thousand details of opening
the Hall. But before the week was closed,
every old boarding-house was closed and the
new home full.</p>

<p class='c008'>Marion Shaw found her time altogether
occupied. Her work was to lie directly among
the girls, as Villard’s influence was to save the
boys and young men. Marion had a gentle
and pleasing manner that made friends everywhere
she went. She had had a good deal of
experience in managing boarding-school girls,
and although they are a widely different class
from factory girls, human nature—girl-nature,
is the same everywhere. Before the week
was over, Marion had made friends with many
of the girls, and had already interested them
in keeping their rooms tidy, in forming a girls’
club, which should embrace all sorts of
good ends, and in rousing in them what was of
infinite value in the work she had laid out,—a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>desire to become as near like her and Salome
as it was possible for them to be.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We shall have to endure the cross of
having them cut all their dresses like ours,
wear ribbons like ours, do up their hair like
ours, and get up the most astonishing hats
purporting to be like ours,” said she to Salome
one night; “but if it all comes of their wanting
to be like us,—you understand me, dear,—I
mean of their wanting to reach a higher
ideal of course,—we can bear it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We shall have to,” was the answer.
“The truth of it is, they will be trying to copy
our habits and manners and characters, too.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then we shall have to be all the more
careful,” said Marion seriously.</p>

<p class='c008'>Life to Marion Shaw was a serious thing.
Although she was but twenty-seven years old,
she had come to realize that life may not be
for any what the fancy of youth pictures it;
and even to realize that the highest good
which life can hold is not to be happy.
Already she knew that happiness is but a
relative term, and that only by ceasing to search
and plan for it, can any of us find it even in
small degree.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>Just now, she walked dangerously near to
happiness. On the opening night, Geoffrey
Burnham had kept closely at her side all the
evening, and after the affair was over, he had
walked home with her, while Robert Fales had
gone ahead with Salome.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the door, the two had paused a little,
looking at the exquisite, moonlit October night.
Suddenly the extraordinary interest Burnham
had felt in this young woman had culminated.
He seized both her hands in his, and pressed
them close to his breast.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why have you not come to me before?”
he murmured, passionately. “Why have you
waited all these years?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I was waiting for you,” she answered, with
a smile.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>XV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>One evening in January, Salome and Marion
went over early to Newbern Shepard Hall.
Marion’s duties called her there every evening,
and she was seldom unaccompanied by her
friend.</p>

<p class='c008'>The success of Salome’s schemes for the interest
of the working-girls seemed already
assured. Although the Hall had been open
but little more than two months, classes in
dressmaking and millinery and in domestic
science were already established, and were well
attended. Some girls there were, it is true,
who felt that, after working all day, they were
entitled to an idle evening, or to the right of
amusing themselves after their own fashion.
But plenty of young women had been found
to open the classes, and the number was steadily
increasing. No strong measures had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>taken to induce these girls to join. Marion
had talked with some of them individually, at
first, and found a few who, half skeptically,
had consented to try the dressmaking class, as
an experiment. Then the announcement was
made that a class would be opened on a certain
night, and twenty-six girls were present.
Instruction in sewing, cutting and fitting was
given free to any woman connected with the
Shawsheen Mills. As the girls had been paying
exorbitant prices for having cheap material
poorly made up, and as Salome had provided
instructors from the best dressmaking establishment
Shepardtown afforded, the girls were
not slow to see the benefit that would come to
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>The young wives of operatives, too, women
with houses and children to care for, then
began to avail themselves of the privileges
which the class afforded. So that, on this January
evening, there were over a hundred and
fifty women in the classes, and another room
had been opened to them on the ground
floor.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was the same with other classes. At first,
the young women had joined with the older
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>ones in “pooh-poohing” the cooking and
housekeeping lectures and demonstrations.
The idea that they and their mothers did not
know how to cook, and that Salome, who knew
absolutely nothing of such matters, essayed to
teach them, was a most distasteful one. But
when they found that a celebrated teacher was
to come out twice a week from Boston, and give
demonstrations in the model class-rooms below,
and that a graduate of the Boston Cooking
School had been engaged to take charge of
the lessons every evening, they, the young
married women from the cottages, especially,
dropped in from curiosity; and although they
had come to scoff, they remained to cook. In
short, they had become deeply interested in the
new ways of housekeeping, and were surprised
and delighted to find a way of making their
few dollars go farther and procure a better and
more healthful living. Consequently, these
classes, too, were full, although the older
matrons did not yet give up their prejudices.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among the girls who had not yet joined the
classes, there were many who sat quietly in
their own rooms or in the large reading-rooms,
and enjoyed the current magazines and papers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>or gossiped quietly and harmlessly about the
fashions and each other—not altogether unlike
women of higher pretensions. It was astonishing,
even to Salome, who had, from the first,
believed in her girls, how few of them went
out on the streets at night.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is not astonishing to me,” said Marion,
that January evening, in reply to a remark from
her friend to this effect. “The girls are tired
at night and are only too glad to have a pleasant,
light and steam-heated place to stay in. Their
rooms at the old boardinghouses were cold, barren
and dismal. In winter weather they could
not sit in them, and the so-called parlor was not
much better. When I was at Mme. Blanc’s
one of her servant girls went wrong. I shall
never forget something she said. When Madame
heard of it, she sent for the girl and asked
her, bitterly, what had made her bring such a
scandalous thing upon a select house like hers.
I was in her room at the time. The poor girl
looked up at Mme. Blanc and said, ‘O, ma’am,
you’re awful particular about where your young
ladies spend their evenings,—girls that you’re
paid for looking after. But us servant girls—how
did you look after us? You didn’t allow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>us a light in our own rooms, or to speak above
a whisper in the kitchen, or seem to think we was
human beings at all. What else could we do,
but go out on the street when we wanted a bit
of freedom? And once, on the street, ma’am,
girls like us ain’t never safe. If you’d looked
out for me, ma’am, and treated me as well as
you treat your own dog or cat, it would never
have happened.’ Poor Madame was overcome
entirely, and the girl left her white with rage.
But she looked after her servants more closely
afterward, and kept them in at night in warm
rooms. I don’t believe our girls want to do
wrong,—especially if we make it comfortable
for them to do right.”</p>

<p class='c008'>On the young men’s side, things had gone
equally well. There was a class of them who,
like their fathers before them, were sturdy,
honest and faithful. It was a small class, but
upon these John Villard depended to counteract
the influence of the lower foreign element
that had crept in; and to the pride of these
he appealed, both directly and indirectly, in
his efforts to establish a better social atmosphere
among the operatives.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a few of these to begin with, he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>opened an evening school on the other wing of
the Hall; and, as in the case of the women’s
classes, it had increased in numbers and interest
from the start. The overseers, almost to a
man, gladly availed themselves of its opportunities
for the education that the true American
always feels the need for; and they, with the
better class of men from the looms and mules,
set the example for others to follow.</p>

<p class='c008'>No better man for the work could have been
chosen than John Villard. He had come up
under much the same conditions that governed
them. He had begun on the lowest round,
and worked up to the position he now occupied,
by hard work and the closest application to
business. This fact, together with his attitude
toward them during the strike, had made him
a favorite with nearly every man on the works.
They felt that they could place the utmost
confidence in Villard; and in the Shawsheen
Mills, as everywhere, a rugged sincerity and
honesty of purpose carried a weight that even
the most unstable felt.</p>

<p class='c008'>The lecture-hall was usually packed at the
weekly entertainment which Salome provided,
and a new feeling of content and self-respect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>had begun to permeate the mills. Make a
man who has been looked upon as a mere
machine feel that he is estimated at something
near the worth which every human being feels
in his heart that he is entitled to, and you have
done much to raise him to a higher social
standard. For the first time since old Newbern
Shepard’s day, the mill-hands began to feel
a just pride in being individual American
citizens. Unconsciously, both men and women
were setting their faces toward the higher
standards which Villard by his life, and
Salome by her newly awakened energy, had
set for them.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the mills, affairs were on a most flourishing
basis. The Shawsheen brand of cloth was
too well known to allow of a few months shutdown
of the mills making any difference in the
law of demand. Orders had increased, even
while the mills were closed, and they had been
worked to their utmost capacity ever since they
had opened. Never had the Shawsheen Mills
been more prosperous than at the beginning of
January, or their future looked brighter.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Villard had opened his evening school
he invited Burnham to co-operate with him;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>but the latter had put him off without a
definite reply, and not until the afternoon of
the day referred to in the beginning of this
chapter had Villard asked him whether or not
he might count on his assistance. Burnham
occasionally looked in at the Hall of an evening,
but Villard had begun to suspect that this
was principally for the purpose of seeing
Marion Shaw.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, to tell the truth,” Burnham finally
admitted, “I’ve no taste for this sort of thing.
Oh, yes; it’s a good scheme, and seems to be
working first-rate; but I’m not the right fellow
for the place. I don’t like philanthropic work,
never did, never shall. I work hard enough
during the day. I need rest and freedom at
night.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Villard smiled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And I suppose I don’t do anything day-times
and need this sort of thing as recreation
and intellectual stimulus?” His tone was
sarcastic, for he had little patience with selfishness
in any form.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, not that,” said Burnham. “You
work hard enough—too hard, in fact. But all
this is more in your line. You’re like Miss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>Shepard; you’re both of you happier working
yourselves to death for others. Now, I’m not
built on that plan. I’ve no faculty for teaching,
and I’m sure that my well-meant efforts to
meet the men half-way are looked upon by
them as condescension on my part.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He waited an instant for Villard to speak,
but no answer came.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t help it. I wasn’t born to the manor,
so to speak. I didn’t come up from the ranks,
as you know. I suppose they’d believe in me
more, if I had. But you know that my
father put me under Mr. Greenough to learn
the business, only after I had graduated from
college and fooled away a year in Europe. I
sometimes doubt if I’m not out of place in this
mill as it is run nowadays.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no, not that,” put in Villard hastily.
“You’re too good a business man. We couldn’t
spare you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can see how it’s all coming out,” Burnham
continued, as if he had not heard Villard.
“You two” (Villard’s heart jumped at the
words) “will go on and make a model institution
of the Shawsheen Mills. I should
doubt if you made a profitable one, only that I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>know you’ve got a mighty good business head
on your shoulders; and, I say, the way Miss
Shepard is developing is a caution to us men.
I’d no idea she’d take such a practical turn, or
learn the details so readily. Oh, I can see where
it’s going to end. She’ll be the recognized head
and you’ll be her first assistant. As for me, I
sha’n’t be in it. I shall have resigned.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jeff!” It was only occasionally that these
two called each other by their boyhood names.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I don’t think I should care to have it
known that I worked under a woman, much
as I admire and respect Miss Shepard. There’d
be no other way, unless I married her!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Villard turned pale with sudden, inward rage,
but he said nothing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t think I’d have much chance there,
though,” Burnham went on lightly. “You’re
more her style. And you’re both so much
wrapped up in good works that you’ve no time
for faith in each other, beyond what you waste
in philanthropic effort. Miss Shepard don’t
seem to be the marrying kind. I don’t believe
she ever thinks of a man unless he has the
merit of being an operative in the mills.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And since you’re bent on discussing matrimonial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>matters,” observed Villard, with sarcasm,
“how about Miss Shaw? And when are the
wedding-cards to be issued?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Burnham shook the ashes from his cigar and
looked at his watch critically.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Marion Shaw is a fine girl,” he said. “She’s
the right kind of woman to tie to; but”—and
Burnham took up his hat to go out—“I’m not
the marrying kind either.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So Villard had come to understand that he
must take care of his evening school as best
he could alone.</p>

<p class='c008'>Robert Fales had settled in Shepardtown.
There were to be more cottages built in the
spring, and to him Salome had alone confided her
plan of erecting a new church which should be
named for her grandfather. When the evening
school began to grow, he went to Villard and
offered his services as assistant, and had proved
a most valuable one.</p>

<p class='c008'>This evening Salome looked in upon them,
and asked Villard if he could give her a few
moments after the class.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shall be very glad,” he replied. “I have
been working up the idea you spoke about the
other day, and wanted to talk with you about it.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>“The profit-sharing scheme?” asked Salome.
“That’s just what I wanted to speak of. It
seems to me we ought, now, at the beginning of
the year, to get it into manageable shape, and
tell the men, so that they may know what to
expect. I will be in the reception-room when
your class is through.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Much as Villard was interested in his work
the remaining hour dragged a little. The
prospect of a quiet <i><span lang="fr">tête-à-tête</span></i> with Salome, even
on so unromantic a subject as profit-sharing,
was too alluring.</p>

<p class='c008'>But, at last, he found himself face to face
with her, and for a few moments forgot all else
in the pleasure of listening to her voice and
watching the curve of her chin and mobile lips,
as she talked of immaterial things.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And now, what kind of a plan have you
formulated as to the profit-sharing?” she
asked, after a little.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Profits—oh, yes,” said Villard, suddenly
brought to himself. “I have examined all
the accounts of such experiments in foreign
countries, and tried to remember the differing
conditions and better wages here. I have
prepared a rough draft of a circular which I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>thought perhaps you might like to send out
among the hands. Do you want to see it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course,” was the answer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t pretend it is complete, you know,”
he went on, drawing a folded paper from his
inner pocket. “It is only an abstract, but—here
it is.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Read it to me, please,” said Salome.</p>

<p class='c008'>He would rather have had her read it, while
he watched her face; but he complied.</p>

<p class='c008'>“For some time past,” the circular read,
“the subject of co-operation in some form has
been considered by the Shawsheen Mills.
Believing that capital and labor are interdependent
and their interests identical, it has
been decided to adopt some plan by which the
laborer may obtain a share of the product in
proportion to the profits of the scheme, at the
same time guaranteeing his wages against the
time of loss.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is now proposed, therefore, to divide a
sum among the Shawsheen employes, each year
in which there are surplus profits, over and
above wages earned.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Understand, that before anything can be
set apart for this purpose, wages must be paid,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>interest must be paid, and a fair profit on
capital must be paid. In addition to this, an
additional amount must be set aside to make
good the wear and tear of buildings and machinery,
and to strengthen reserve funds against
a time of depression.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ordinarily, the sum above all these amounts
must be small, and must differ, of course, with
the fluctuations of the market, the depression of
trade, and the wear of machinery from year to
year. It will be readily seen, also, that the
sum to be divided will be enlarged by extra
care and attention on the part of employes.
Every weaver who makes a mis-pick, every
burler who slights her work, every spinner who
makes a needless knot; in short, every person
who makes an unnecessary waste of any kind,
makes the amount to be divided smaller, by
making a loss to the concern; and, on the
other hand, if every person in the mill attends
to the little savings, the wool-washers saving
every scrap of wool, the spinners making less
waste, the weavers weaving up the whole
bobbin, and so on through all the branches, a
great saving can be made which will effectually
increase the sum to be divided; and it will be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>for the direct interest of every employe to
exercise such increased care and diligence.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The mode of distributing this bonus will be
by making a dividend of so much per cent. upon
the wages earned by each person. If, after all
contingencies are provided for, there is not
enough left to make a dividend of one per
cent., no dividend will be made for that year.
In case of a dividend it will be paid on and
after the first day of May in each year to all
employes who have been in employ at the
Shawsheen Mills for at least seven months
during the year, and shall not have been
discharged for drunken or disorderly conduct.
The amount of wages earned during the year
preceding the first of April shall be the
amount upon which the bonus for each individual
shall be computed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The profit for the present year, if there be
a dividend, will be paid on or after the first
day of May. Let every person connected with
the mills work so faithfully, making every
effort toward a wise economy, that the first
dividend shall be an encouraging one.”</p>

<p class='c008'>John Villard stopped reading the circular
and looked across at Salome. She was regarding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>him with a fixed look of admiration and
reverence, such as a good woman feels for but
one man in a lifetime. For an instant his
pulses leaped; but he was too modest a man to
believe in his own good fortune.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, what do you think of it?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>His words brought her to herself. Her
expression faded to one of mere brightness,
and became less frankly honest.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think it capital,” she said. “I do not see
how it can be improved. Will you let me take
it home and consider it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course,” he assented. “You know I
do not pretend it is perfect. But it seems to
me we risk nothing in trying it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Salome rose to go and reached out her hand
for the manuscript. Some pieces had fallen
on the table and in gathering them up, their
hands brushed against each other.</p>

<p class='c008'>An electric thrill shot through the frame of
each. Salome stood, blushing and sweet,
suddenly conscious that a crucial moment in
her life had come. Had Villard but spoken,
had he but clasped the hand that still remained
near his!</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>But, ever depreciating himself and knowing
absolutely nothing of the heart of woman, he
turned abruptly away, bringing Salome back
to herself with a hasty “good-evening.” And
then he strode away to the outer air, asking
himself, savagely, why he was so weak and
boyish because a pretty woman happened to
touch his hand.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>XVI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>All through the winter months, Geoffrey
Burnham and Marion Shaw were constantly
meeting. As Burnham had intimated to Villard,
he had taken only a superficial interest
in the philanthropic or ethical side of mill-economy.
But he was often at the Hall of an
evening; and upon pleasant nights, when the
ladies walked over from the Shepard mansion,
he accompanied them home after the evening’s
engagement. If it were early, as on ordinary
occasions, he went in and sat chatting with
them for an hour or two. Mrs. Soule always
welcomed him, and although she never went to
the Hall, she found ample opportunities of
telling him how many lonely hours it caused
her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I often wish Salome cared half as much,”
she used plaintively to say on these occasions,
“for a living aunt as for a dead grandfather.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>Often, Burnham sang to Salome’s accompaniment,
his rich tenor voice lending pathos,
and his ardent glances a meaning, for Marion
in the love-songs he sang so well. The latter
sat silent at such times, a quiet content wrapping
her round, forgetting the past, ignoring
the future.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A blind man’s paradise,” she told herself it
was, as the weeks rolled by, and the glamour
of a scarcely hinted but very evident passion
waited in vain for more than the vaguest expression.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sometimes the two were left alone for a
while, when the conversation took a fitful tone,
as if uncertain whether to be light and frivolous,
or tender and deep. Several times Burnham
had seized Marion’s unresisting hand and
kissed it passionately; and, finally, one evening
when they were alone, he had put his arm
about her waist and drawn her close to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why have we not had each other all these
years?” he asked, looking into her sweet, confused
eyes. “What cruel fate has kept you
from me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It does not matter, does it, so long as we
have each other now?” Marion had asked in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>reply. And then he had bent and kissed the
pure white brow and the clustering rings of
hair.</p>

<p class='c008'>After this, every night, Marion, kneeling by
her bedside alone, thanked God for the love
that had come to brighten her bereaved life.</p>

<p class='c008'>And Burnham? Did he realize what he
might be doing when he won this true and
loyal woman’s heart? At first, he, too, was
happy in the present. The past held nothing
which he was proud to remember; and into the
future he stubbornly refused to look. He had,
for years,—“since his days of adolescence,”
he told himself,—had no interest in women,
although he knew that, in a place like Shepardtown,
he was the object of several fond mammas’
machinations, and the admiration of most
of the village girls. He had never met
Marion’s counterpart. She interested and fascinated
him. Simple and childish in many
ways, she was grave and dignified in others.
Her life, he could see, would be spent for
others. She was one of those women who are
a constant sacrifice to the world around them;
who give openly and always of their best, asking
and expecting little in return. In short-Burnham
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>knew it as well as any one could—she
was a woman whose life and love and
utmost service would be absorbed by a selfish
man, only to be as unappreciated as they were
undeserved on his part. And yet, ever since
their first meeting, months before, there had
been that subtle consciousness of each other
drawing them on, that wave of feeling on
meeting, that positive yearning when they were
separated.</p>

<p class='c008'>After Villard’s pointed questioning regarding
Marion, Burnham began to question himself
seriously. At first, when thoughts of the
future had intruded into his calm moments, he
thought of her as his wife; of himself as settled
down in a house of his own; he even expected
to be happy. But he did not put his thoughts
into words. When he was with Marion, he
avoided—not so much from intention perhaps
as from a reluctance to break the spell of romance
which hung over them—any mention
of different relations in the future.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was April before he brought himself to
face about and look at the subject, calmly and
seriously. Just where was he drifting with
Marion?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>One day he allowed himself to let fall some
remark about her to Villard,—not in any way
implying their peculiar relations, but yet speaking
of her in such a way that Villard drew himself
up to his straightest, and looked him in
the eye a full moment. Not a word was said,
but at that instant, Burnham felt the disagreeable
consciousness of being a scoundrel.</p>

<p class='c008'>He went home that evening and tried to read.
Then he tried to smoke. Then he thought of
going over to the Shepard mansion. He finally
decided on sitting down and squarely meeting
an issue that should have been faced six months
before.</p>

<p class='c008'>Geoffrey Burnham was thirty-seven years old.
He had considered only his own taste and
desires ever since he was born. When he was
a boy, if he had wanted anything, he had it.
If his father did not grant his every wish his
mother would. And she, poor woman, had
fostered in him the idea that all his personal,
imperious desires were meant, always, to be
immediately granted. The conquering of Self
had been no part of his early discipline.</p>

<p class='c008'>His father died when he was in Europe.
When he came home, and entered the mills,—an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>arrangement the father effected just before his
decease,—his pretty, white-faced mother had
come to Shepardtown to be near her son. For
him she lived and would die. Yielding weakly
in everything to him, she avenged her position
by setting herself against all other women.
Salome had called upon her, and had invited
her to her house, but in vain. Mrs. Burnham
went nowhere, and wanted to see no one. Her
son was all in all to her. And but for the
constant fear that he would marry the handsome
Miss Shepard, who, with all her wealth, she
felt sure, would crowd her completely out of
her son’s heart and home, she would have been
a comparatively happy woman. Incredible to
larger-hearted women, as it seems, there are
women so selfish in their devotion to an only
son, as to wreck his life, so far as its being
of any practical value to himself and others is
concerned, by the strength of their own
weak persistence.</p>

<p class='c008'>Burnham thought of his mother. He remembered
the comfortable habits he had settled
into; he wondered if any other woman would
ever let him smoke in the best room in the
house, or submit to his will when he chose, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>he often did for days together, to speak only
in monosyllables in his own house. He felt
that, should he marry, his habits would all
have to be changed; that the solitude which
he prized, when he felt so inclined, might be
absolute no longer. He remembered his
mother’s peculiarities, and said to himself that
there would be a devil of a row, should he
undertake to bring a wife home. There might
be constant bickerings, and that he never
could abide. No; better let women alone.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he thought of Marion and sighed.
Her tender eyes, when he parted from her two
nights before, came up before him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hang it,” he asked himself; “just how
far have I gone with her, anyway?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He felt himself a scoundrel again, to his
credit be it written. But then, there were the
habits of a lifetime, and his mother to be
remembered. Could he overthrow all his
established convictions?</p>

<p class='c008'>And yet, just what might Marion be
expecting of him? No, he had given her no
definite encouragement in words. Still, one
never can tell how a good, pure woman is
going to take these things.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>Burnham went out under the April sky and
walked up and down the concrete walk bareheaded,
until his mother, from her window,
reminded him for the third time that he would
certainly get cold out there; and shouldn’t
she make him a cup of hot negus? Then he
came in and renewed the conflict.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve let the thing run too long,” he said
to himself, as he gazed into the open wood-fire,
having refused the decoction his mother had
patiently brought him. “I’ll have a reckoning
with myself to-night, and decide this thing
once for all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Burnham was a decided man, and, once
determined, seldom changed his mind. He
boasted, sometimes, of that quality, forgetting
that it is only an ignorant or an unprogressive
soul which will never acknowledge itself in the
wrong, or change its course from the one marked
out, perhaps in obstinacy or error.</p>

<p class='c008'>Until midnight he argued with himself,
although, unconsciously, his mind had been
secretly made up at the start. When the clock
struck twelve he rose and got together his
writing materials.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had fully decided that it would be folly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>for him to marry Marion Shaw. She was a
rarely devoted, unselfish woman, and a most
lovable one; but he knew himself, he said, and
if she married him she would do so only to be
unhappy in the end. She could not be otherwise,
living with him and his mother.</p>

<p class='c008'>But how was he to withdraw from the delicate
situation in which he had foolishly placed
himself? There was, he decided, but one way.</p>

<p class='c008'>For a year, now, Salome Shepard had been
making a deep and practical study of the mills
and their operation. She had proved a wonderfully
apt scholar, her womanly intuition often
grasping, in a few minutes, details which he
had been months in learning. He doubted if,
should occasion require it, she could not run
the mills alone. With Villard—honest, faithful
soul!—to help her, Burnham felt that there
was no longer any need of his services at the
Shawsheen Mills. There was another superintendency
in a mill at Lowell which stood
open to him, whenever he chose to take it.
There were some things about it that he would
not like; but he must not remain on dangerous
ground. He took great credit to himself
as he reflected that honor required him not to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>trifle with Marion’s feelings another day. He
virtuously decided to take himself out of her
way. Once gone from her she would cease to
feel his attraction and forget the tender scenes
between them. He would resign his connection
with the Shawsheen Mills.</p>

<p class='c008'>He sat down and wrote the letter of resignation.
Then he went to bed and slept. He,
like Villard, had kept awake hours for a
woman. But he was not the man to conquer
his selfish nature, or to grow stronger by
fighting himself.</p>

<hr class='c011'>

<p class='c008'>The next morning Salome found Villard
alone in the inner office of the mills. A note
lay on her desk. It was Burnham’s resignation.</p>

<p class='c008'>She uttered an exclamation of surprise, and
turned to Villard.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did you know about this?” she asked,
handing him the note.</p>

<p class='c008'>Villard looked as astonished as though a
dynamite bomb had exploded in the mill-yard.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not a word,” he said. “But stay, he did
hint at something, months ago; but I never
gave it a second thought. ‘Decided that he
is no longer needed on the works, and an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>opportunity having offered to better his condition.’
H’m! Those are his reasons?
Strange he hadn’t mentioned the matter to me
although it <em>was</em> his own business.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But what are we going to do? Can’t we
get him back?” asked Salome.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We can try,” was the reply, “but Burnham
is a pretty determined fellow when he
fairly makes up his mind. Shall I go over
and see him?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you please. Tell him to come back
with you; I want to persuade him to stay if I
can.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Villard went over to Burnham’s house,
but he had already gone to Lowell to complete
arrangements to enter the new position.
Mrs. Burnham knew nothing of either this
plan or her son’s sudden resignation. Villard
returned to Salome.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What are we going to do,” she asked,
“supposing he refuses to come back—even at
an increased salary?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t you think you and I can run the
business alone for a while?” returned Villard,
“at least until we can find a good man. Good
superintendents don’t grow on every bush.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>“Do you think I am capable of taking his
place—with your help, of course?” Salome
looked earnestly at him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think you are quite capable of doing
anything noble and great,” he answered,
fervently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“With your help,” she said, in a low tone.
“Of course I will do anything, and shall be
only too proud,” she hastened to add, “if I
have succeeded in learning enough of the
business to be of any use.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Villard looked again at her averted eyes, and
checked an impulse to say something more.
Had he known a tenth as much of women as
of cotton factories, his fortune and happiness
had been in his own hands. But he honestly
thought she had turned away her eyes and
spoken the last sentence to turn him away from
saying more; while she was saying to herself
as she turned to her desk again:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Will he never, never speak? It will come,
some time, I am sure, but will he never dare?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>XVII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Burnham returned to Shepardtown only to
tell his mother that he should go to Lowell
immediately. He had accepted the standing
offer there, and expected to begin at once.</p>

<p class='c008'>In vain Salome offered him an increase of
salary. And as he was evidently bent on
going, she would not urge him to remain in
her employ. But both she and Villard could
assign but one reason for his sudden determination.
Both felt sure that he had offered himself
to Marion and that she had refused him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Intimate as Salome and Marion were, no
discussion of love-matters ever entered their
conversation. With each, love was too high
and sacred a thing to be bruited about, even
in a conversation between friends. In their
younger days, when Marion had shyly
announced her engagement to a young law-student,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>there had been no silly or sentimental
waste of words between them on the subject.
And now, perhaps because both women felt
the stirrings of a deep passion in their inmost
heart, no reference to the subject was ever
made.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Salome went home to lunch, she told
Marion of Burnham’s resignation; but beyond
a momentary look of blank astonishment
Marion’s face gave no sign. And Salome’s
feeling for her friend was too deep and too
delicate, to ask for what she did not choose to
tell voluntarily.</p>

<p class='c008'>Burnham would have been glad to leave
town without risking himself in Marion’s
presence again.</p>

<p class='c008'>He feared to trust himself with her, in the
presence of the strange attraction she had held
for him. But common courtesy demanded
that he should call at the Mansion to leave
his good-byes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Marion heard the news of his resignation
with a strange sinking of the heart. Something
told her that this was the end of her
foolish, happy dream. And although she
loyally refused to acknowledge her doubts,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>the strange presaging which was something
more than presentiment lurked in her heart
all day, and kept her uneasy and restless. She
half expected Burnham to come in and by a
few words settle the question of their relations.
She even asked herself, how she could best
leave Shepardtown if he insisted upon taking
her to Lowell.</p>

<p class='c008'>But he did not come until evening. Then
it happened, as events will in this strange
world, that she was with her classes at the
Hall. Salome was unusually tired that evening
and had remained quietly at home. Burnham
dropped in about eight o’clock, sat for
half an hour with her and Mrs. Soule, and
then bade them good-bye, leaving his adieu
for Marion. He did not go to the Hall,
although she half expected him all through the
long evening. The next morning he took an
early train for Lowell.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Marion came home she heard in
amazement that Burnham had been there and
gone. Salome gave her his word of parting.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And was that all?” Marion asked, with
strained voice and blazing cheeks.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That was all. Tell me, dear,” asked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>Salome, for the first time, “was there any
trouble between you? Had you anything to
do with his going?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, nothing,” and Marion was gone to her
room.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the first day of May, the experiment of
profit-sharing was put into effect for the first
time at the Shawsheen Mills. In spite of the
strike, and the enforced idleness of several
months which had followed, previous to the year
just passed, this had been a successful one, and
when the divisions for capital, machinery and reserve
fund had been set aside, there still remained
a surplus which gave a dividend of four and
a half per cent. In some cases, this dividend
on wages made a very considerable sum, and in
all cases the operatives felt a new sensation of
direct responsibility and connection with the
mills. Besides the addition of this money to
their wages, the feeling of brotherhood and
ownership it engendered was, Villard declared,
quite worth the experiment.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another circular was sent out, urging the
operatives to increased care in saving and
painstaking in order that the dividend might
be larger another year. And the good results
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>of the plan were directly manifest in the work
of nearly every employe.</p>

<p class='c008'>A little incident which occurred soon after
this did much to convince the men of the
changed relations in which they now stood
towards their employers.</p>

<p class='c008'>An overseer had been tyrannizing over the
spinners until they would endure it no longer.
In Mr. Greenough’s day, it is more than probable
that the matter would have culminated in
a lock-out or a strike.</p>

<p class='c008'>But with the new order of things came a
greater feeling of confidence in Villard. Five
of the spinners, therefore, with the consent
of the others, went personally to the superintendent.</p>

<p class='c008'>After hearing their story, Villard promised
to settle their grievance, and quite a discussion
of economic questions concerning Capital
<em>versus</em> Labor followed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You men have labor to sell,” said Villard,
“and we buy it. We have the products of
your labor to sell, and the commission merchants
and others buy it. As much courtesy
and fair dealing should exist between us, as I
like to have between us and the men to whom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>we sell. We would not take insolence from a
broker’s clerk; you need not put up with the
tyranny of an overseer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>These words, repeated to the other employes,
were the most powerful preventive against
strikes ever tried in the Shawsheen Mills.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the summer advanced, other new cottages
were built on the hill to accommodate the
growing demand from the operatives. All
those built the previous year were occupied,
and many of them had been bought on the
installment plan. Although the community
around the Shawsheen factories, as it now
existed, had come suddenly into its new relation,
it already represented almost an ideal one.
It was already a practical lesson in social
economics, which many a reformer and many a
capitalist would do well to study. To be a
capitalist even in a small way is to learn to
respect capital. The fact that these men
owned their small plots of ground and their
cottages (even if they were mortgaged for the
greater part of their value) was already dignifying
the laborer by the tangible proof of his
own value.</p>

<p class='c008'>By this time, Salome had come to know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>every family who were in the employ of the
mills. Was there trouble coming to any
household, was there sickness, was there affliction
among them, they all turned to her for
help and sympathy, encouragement or congratulation.
The smallest events—the birth
of a baby, the progress of measles, the love
affairs of the young, the querulous complaints
of the old—were all of interest to her; and
they, in return, appreciated her kindness and
returned it with a loyalty of service that did
her soul good.</p>

<p class='c008'>Salome often declared, laughingly, that
her relations to them were truly patriarchal.
An atmosphere of content and friendliness
prevailed where there had been jealousy and
bickering.</p>

<p class='c008'>The popular entertainments were kept up
during the summer. There were concerts, at
which local talent (often some operative who
possessed the faculty of singing a song)
appeared. Salome, herself, often presided at
the piano, and Marion frequently lent her
voice; their theory being that young people who
took little or no vacation in summer needed
some sort of recreation in summer as in winter.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>Towards the close of the summer, as Salome
came out of the Hall one evening, one of the
young men came up to her side, and asked if
he might speak to her alone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Certainly,” she said; “Mr. Fales, will you
walk ahead with Marion, while O’Donovan
walks home with me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She remembered the young fellow perfectly.
She had seen him first during the strike, a
handsome young dare-devil who seemed, in
fact, to be one of the ringleaders among the
younger men. When the mills had re-opened,
she had taken an uncommon interest in him.
He was a faithful and industrious man, and
when, after a few weeks of sneering at the
“new-fangled notions,” he had settled into
harmony with the strange atmosphere, he had
tried to improve himself in many ways. When
Villard took charge of the evening school,
he had held aloof for a few weeks, but at
last joined one of Fales’ classes. In their
entertainments and dances, he had taken leading
parts; and that day, Villard had offered
him the post of overseer in one of the minor
departments at the mills. It was quite a step
up for the young man, and Villard had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>surprised at his hesitation in accepting the
offer.</p>

<p class='c008'>Salome knew all this; and as she heartily
liked the fellow, she determined to influence
him for his own interest.</p>

<p class='c008'>O’Donovan was silent for some moments,
after they started, doubtless being unaccustomed
to escort ladies of her degree in that friendly
way. But Salome soon put him at his ease by
her kind and easy manner.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And so you’re going to be promoted,” she
said, after a little. “I hope you like that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Miss Shepard,” he blurted out in confused
speech, “that’s what I want to talk about.
There’s something—I mean, I want to tell—I
<em>ought</em> to tell you something, Miss Shepard.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well. It oughtn’t to be very difficult
to do that,” and her tone was cordial and encouraging.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t think I ought to take the position—unless
you say so. But I expect you’ll put
me in irons, if I tell you. Only—well, the
other fellows would say I was a blasted fool—barrin’
your presence, miss.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, John,” exclaimed Salome wonderingly.
For the young man was in a great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>state of excitement. “What can it be?
Surely, you know you need not be afraid of
me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You remember the night some one tried
to blow up the mill—and Mr. Greenough—and
Mr. Villard——” Salome stood still and gazed
through the summer moonlight at her strange
escort. He did not look up, but stood like a
culprit before her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know how you managed to find
out and save ’em,” he went on. “Miss
Shepard—it was me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You? John O’Donovan!” For an instant
there was silence.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go on,” she said, when she could command
her voice. “Tell me all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was John Ross that planned it and put
me up to it. When he died, I wondered if he
hadn’t told you or Mr. Villard. Ever since
then, I’ve been trying to, but somehow I
couldn’t—tell Mr. Villard—nor you neither.—It
was John Ross that planned it. He called
me a coward and a scab—and, finally, well—you
know I was a crazy fool then, with the
rest of ’em.—It ain’t no use talkin’, miss, but
we all discussed and brooded over things until
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>we were half out of our heads. If any one of
us had weakened first, we’d all give up, and the
strike would have bu’st; but—well, ’tain’t no
use talkin’, I s’pose. I’ve confessed, and you
can have me put in irons, if you want to.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How did you come to want to tell me,
John?” Salome said softly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, miss, when I found how you saved the
mill that night, and the lives of those two men,
I went down on my knees with thankfulness.
It somehow seemed to open my eyes to where
I’d been standin’. Then, when the mills
opened and you took us back, and when you
commenced to take an interest in us; when
you built that beautiful big Hall, and all
them cottages; and, if you’ll pardon me for
sayin’ it, when you begun walkin’ thro’ the
mills yourself, speakin’ a pleasant word to us
all and smilin’ at us as if we were all your
equals, miss—and you a saint,——it was then
I seemed no better’n a murderer. And when
John Ross died, and the detectives gave up
lookin’ for the men, it was bore in on me as
how I ought to confess; and to-day, when Mr.
Villard called me into the office and praised
my work, and said I’d been faithful and trustworthy——<em>trustworthy</em>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>ma’am!—why, then,
I couldn’t stand it no longer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The young man stood silent in the moonlight.
Salome’s eyes were filled with tears.</p>

<p class='c008'>“John,” she said, “you are a noble fellow.
It is no more than right that you should confess
this to me, but not all fellows in your place
could do it. You can because you have the
making of a man in you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The young man looked up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And what are you goin’ to do with me?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Will you do just what I say?” returned
Salome.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will, indeed,” he said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then I want you to go to Mr. Villard to-morrow
morning and tell him you accept the
place. Then do your best, and deserve better
things in future.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Miss Shepard!” Young O’Donovan fairly
gasped.</p>

<p class='c008'>“John,” she went on, and she seemed to him
like the pictures of saints in the church, as she
stood in her white gown in the silvery light,
“if your scheme had succeeded, you would not
only have destroyed most valuable property of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>mine; you would have killed two of my dearest
friends; but you have turned over a new
leaf. I feel sure that nothing will ever induce
you to consent to anything of the kind again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Never, so help me Heaven!” he exclaimed,
fervently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, you have confessed like a man, I
will forgive like a woman. You will accept
the new place. You will go on studying and
improving yourself, and some day I shall be
proud of you, and you will be proud that you
once had the manliness to come to me and
confess a crime. Now, we will bury the thing
forever, and never speak of it again. Only
promise me you will go to Mr. Villard in the
morning and do as I ask you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I promise,” said the young man solemnly.
Then he dropped on his knees and seizing her
hand, bent his head reverently upon it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If the God in Heaven above is like you,”
he said, “He is a God worth serving.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My poor forgiveness resembles His, John,
only as a drop of rain resembles the mighty
ocean.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They walked silently home, and O’Donovan
left her with a new purpose in his heart that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>has never left it since. He is to-day a thriving
Christian gentleman. Dare any one say it
would have been better to condemn him as a
law-breaker?</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nobody but a woman, I suppose, would
have dealt justice so,” said Salome to herself,
as she put out her light an hour later, and
turned to the window—“nobody but John
Villard.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>XVIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A year rolled by—a year of prosperity to
the Shawsheen Mills, and of growth and improvement
in the condition of their operatives.
John Villard had been made first superintendent
and a new man had taken his place.
Salome continued to act as her own agent and
had developed a keen love and tact for the
business,—a condition of affairs which Mrs.
Soule never ceased to bemoan.</p>

<p class='c008'>The young people at the Hall were more than
ever the dearest objects of her solicitude. In
most cases, their elevation had been steady and
substantial. Young men had become self-respecting
and carried themselves with increased
dignity. Young women gradually grew less
frivolous and more earnest. Thrown together
under so much better conditions than formerly,
both sexes emulated the politeness which they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>were quick to notice between Villard and Salome.
They became more quiet and decorous; they
read a better class of books; they began, in their
way, to cultivate higher tastes than had been
known in the old factory boarding-house or
among the tumble-down tenement houses. Several
marriages had taken place, at which Salome
had acted as the girl’s guardian, giving away
the bride. Young O’Donovan’s was the first of
these. His increased pay as overseer enabled
him to marry Kitty Kendall, to whom he had
long been devoted; and the young bridegroom
was even happier than the bride when Salome
offered to act in that capacity. Neither of
them would have dared ask it of her, but her
evident willingness to act on this occasion encouraged
those who came after, until Salome
said she felt all the responsibilities of a mother
with a large family of daughters.</p>

<p class='c008'>As Villard saw all this marrying and giving
in marriage, he grew, at times, more restless.
There were occasions when he came suddenly
upon Salome, or, perhaps during their rare
talks together, when he felt sure for a moment
that she felt for him more than a friendly
interest. But, remembering his comparative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>poverty, he never spoke the one word which
would have broken down all barriers. And
Salome successfully concealed her feeling for
him, not daring, even, to examine it herself.
So they had drifted on, more than friends and
less than lovers, through another year.</p>

<p class='c008'>There came, at last, the first period of
absence from each other since Mr. Greenough’s
death. Daily association, pleasant as it is, cannot
teach lovers how much they love, as can a
short separation.</p>

<p class='c008'>The second dividend of the mills had been
declared, each operative getting three and a
half per cent., this time, on their wages. When
the work consequent on this transaction was
closed up, it was decided to put new machinery
in the lower mills. There was an improved
kind in one of the Holyoke mills, and it was
decided that Villard should go, personally, to
examine its workings, leaving Salome and the
second superintendent alone for a few days.</p>

<p class='c008'>Villard had made his preparations to start
with a strange sinking at the heart. He was
not a man to indulge in silly presentiment, but
he could not feel any enthusiasm about going.
He had not taken two days away from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>mills in two years, and was justly entitled to a
vacation; but every time he thought of going
to Holyoke, his heart sank within him.</p>

<p class='c008'>He thought it was because he must leave
Salome, and chided himself for his sentimental
fancies. He told himself to be a man; not a
silly fool. And, finally, he refused to think of
his premeditated journey, since he could not do
so comfortably.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was to leave Shepardtown on a seven-thirty
express, west. Salome remained at
the office unusually late that afternoon. She
made him go carefully over her various duties,
and recount, over and over again, everything
necessary for her to say or do while he was
gone.</p>

<p class='c008'>The other superintendent was called away
early, and she was left alone with Villard in the
inner office, the clerks coming in and out and
Marion dropping in once on a trifling errand.</p>

<p class='c008'>Finally, she said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I suppose I must bid you good-bye.
I hope you won’t be gone long.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She held out her hand and Villard took it.
A subtle fire shot from it straight to Villard’s
heart. He looked up. Were her eyes, so soft
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>and kind, suffused with tears? Was this the
strong, self-reliant Salome?</p>

<p class='c008'>“Miss Shepard, Salome,” he burst out, incoherently,
“I——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come right in this way,” said a hearty
voice at the other door. “Villard will tell you
what you want to know——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good-bye,” said Salome again, in the most
matter-of-fact tone, releasing her hand just in
time, as the other superintendent ushered in a
buyer from the west. “Good-bye and good
luck;” and turning, she walked away with
the nonchalant air which a woman knows so
well how to assume, even at the most serious
moment of her life.</p>

<p class='c008'>Poor Villard was both confused and exalted
by the sudden dawn of blessedness, which had
as suddenly faded. He turned to the buyer
but was incoherent, and gave wrong prices on
the last shipment of cotton, so that his customer
felt obliged to call him back to his
senses by a not over-delicate allusion to the
parting he was shrewd enough to guess he had
interrupted.</p>

<p class='c008'>Salome went home in a strangely depressed
mood. She ate but little dinner, and excusing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>herself early in the evening on the plea of
unusual weariness, she retired to her room, undressed
and donned a silken night-wrapper,
only to lie awake all night, worrying herself
with fruitless questioning. In the watches of
the night and under cover of the dark, she
told herself that she had given her heart unsought;
that had Villard loved her as she did
him, nothing could have kept him from saying
so; that she had been vain and conceited in
fancying that, under his quiet demeanor, he
loved her.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then she remembered his sudden, yearning
look when he had grasped her hand, and that,
from the depths of his great, manly heart, he
had called her “Salome.” And then, woman-like,
she shed a few hot tears of gratitude and
impatience.</p>

<p class='c008'>Marion Shaw, meanwhile, had gone to the
Hall alone that evening. Her work among
the mill-girls had grown dearer to her heart
with every month. Most of the girls loved
her now, and looked upon her as a comrade,
though walking on much higher ground
than they. Many of them had secret aspirations
to reach the standard of her ideals, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>they dimly conceived it, and were the better
for trying.</p>

<p class='c008'>Marion had not had a long fight with herself
when weeks had rolled into months, and
she heard no word from Burnham.</p>

<p class='c008'>She had always been an individual girl—one
who thought for herself, who set high ideals
for herself, who believed that one only does
one’s duty by living at one’s highest and noblest.</p>

<p class='c008'>When she was a mere girl she had become
acquainted with a young college-student, and
their friendship ripened into love. When she
became engaged to Ralph Leland, Marion
looked upon her betrothal as no less sacred
than a marriage vow. When, after a few
years of study and close confinement in a
theological seminary, Leland had shown
symptoms of consumption and been ordered to
Colorado, her mother was slowly nearing her
death, with the same disease. It had wrung
her heart with anguish to decide between them,
but Leland had said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stay with your mother, Marion. She
cannot live long and needs you with her to the
end. I shall live many years, and, I feel confident,
may yet entirely recover. It is hard,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>but your mother can have but a year or two
at the most. I hope to live for many years.
And we could neither of us be happy if we
remembered her here, sorrowing and suffering
alone.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And so Marion had staid to nurse her dying
mother, and Ralph Leland had gone west to
seek health and strength. In two months he
was seized with congestion of the lungs and
died suddenly, away from all friends and apart
from her.</p>

<p class='c008'>What Marion suffered at this time, only a
woman can understand. What she endured,
only a woman who has gone down into the
blackness of despair can conceive. Her
mother failing gradually, her lover gone, what
wonder that, for a time, life seemed a blank?</p>

<p class='c008'>After the first, she had not talked about
Ralph, but nursed his memory silently, day
and night. For eighteen months, she took
sole care of her mother, seeing her slip away
into the “great unknown,” inch by inch.
Never did the mother realize that she was
going to die, and she constantly made plans for
the next season when she was going to be “so
much better.” Often Marion, knowing she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>was soon to be motherless, would leave her low
seat near her mother, and stand behind the
invalid’s chair to hide the tears that welled
up, even while she agreed with the invalid’s
plans.</p>

<p class='c008'>Day by day, the gnawing agony of seeing
her mother slowly dying before her melted
into and overshadowed the loss of that love
which was to have shielded and defended her
till death. But she never gave way, before
mortal eyes, to her sorrow; and she never
failed to minister to the mother who so needed
her care.</p>

<p class='c008'>By and by she was left alone. Then, for
the first time, did the awful sense of loss overpower
her. For days she did not sleep or
take any nourishment. Then she rallied and
girded herself for the struggle for existence
which such women must make, and which, in
her case, had been eased by the door which
Salome had opened to her.</p>

<p class='c008'>Through all her trials and discouragement,
Ralph Leland had been a present reality to her.
Even since the first blackness of darkness she
had believed that somewhere, somehow, she
would meet him as of old, and they would live
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>again for each other. Then she came to
believe that he loved her still, wherever in
God’s great universe he might be.</p>

<p class='c008'>“When he was in Colorado,” she used to
say to herself, “I never had a doubt that he
loved me still. If he had gone to the farthest
corner of the earth I should not have dreamed
of his forgetting me. Why should I now,
when he has only gone to a remoter part of the
universe?”</p>

<p class='c008'>This thought was the one, calm, sustaining
help to her in all her work. And in this belief
she was strong to take up any burden which
might be laid upon her.</p>

<p class='c008'>When she came to Shepardtown and met
Burnham, she had been struck by the subtle,
strange resemblance to Ralph which she saw in
him. It was more than the mere resemblance
of feature. It was the resemblance of expression,
of looks, of the intangible essence of life.</p>

<p class='c008'>From this point on, so long as she came in
daily contact with Burnham, she was fascinated
by this ever-recurring resemblance; sometimes
she was half-persuaded that it was Leland who
talked or sang to her, and she sat watching him
in dreamy remembrance of the old days, before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>her mother or Ralph had sickened. As she grew
gradually to believe that Burnham loved her,
she thanked Heaven that a good man’s love was
to brighten her life once more. When the
veil was rent away, and she saw that Burnham
was not the true, white-souled knight she had
thought him, and realized that he was not the
ideal she had believed and trusted in, she was
surprised to find that she no longer loved him.
And then she thought out the true solution.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the night of Villard’s departure, as has
been said, Marion had gone to the work she
most delighted in—her work among the girls.
There were classes to be overlooked, and her
own special one in singing to be taught. She
was half through the musical hour, when she
turned suddenly towards the door. There
stood Geoffrey Burnham.</p>

<p class='c008'>Afterwards she remembered how little feeling
the sight of him caused her. But then she
said pleasantly:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, won’t you walk in and hear us sing?
My girls have made decided improvement since
you heard us last,” and she went on composedly
with the class.</p>

<p class='c008'>Burnham looked on wonderingly. As he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>watched this self-possessed young woman, his
old passion flamed up within him. He had
never cared for her as at that moment. When
the class was over, she advanced toward him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Aren’t you going to shake hands with a
fellow?” he said, holding out his own.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Certainly,” she said, without the least emotion.
He would have retained his hold upon
her hand, but she withdrew it, saying:</p>

<p class='c008'>“To what accident are we indebted for this
unexpected pleasure?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I came,” he said, “on business. I must
see Villard. But they tell me he won’t be
home for several days. There’s a certain combination
of forces we want to get him into, if
possible.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You won’t, you know,” laughed Marion,
“unless it’s for the good of the working-men.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, it is,” answered Burnham. “A
society is being planned for Lowell, which will
do for the operatives there something like that
which Villard and Salome and you have been
doing here. I said I would come down and
consult with him to-night. Besides, I——can’t
you guess any other reason for my coming?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, plenty of them,” replied Marion indifferently.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>“I suppose you feel a friendship for
all who were once your people, and rather want
to see them once more.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not that, at all,” said he significantly,
determined now that she should hear him out.
“Are you going home? May I walk down
with you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Marion gave her permission and went for
her wraps. She half felt what was coming,
but she was strangely apathetic.</p>

<p class='c008'>When they were out under the stars, the
talk began in commonplaces; but Burnham
soon veered it round where he chose.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why are you so cold?” he asked, half
querulously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Cold?” she repeated, purposely misunderstanding
him. “I’m not cold. This wrap I
have on is warmer than it looks.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And your heart,—is that?” retorted he.</p>

<p class='c008'>Marion did not answer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You know I love you. I—know you once
loved me,” he went on, losing his head, as a
consequence of her indifference. “Perhaps
you resented my treating you as I did. Perhaps
I didn’t do right, going off that way,
without a word; but I thought it better
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>so. You see—my mother,—and I,—Marion
Shaw!”—he seized her hand, grasping it in
both his own—“will you marry me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Marion withdrew her hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was cool, and she felt like a spectator at
stage theatricals which did not concern her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Marion, you did love me, you can’t deny
it!” he said. “What is the trouble?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m sorry you have brought this subject up
to-night,” she said, gently. “It had much
better have remained dead and buried.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Marion Shaw, you shall not evade me so,”
retorted Burnham, led on by her steady refusal
to respond to his passion. “You did love me—I
was sure of it—or else, you are the basest
of coquettes, and were playing with me. And
now you are tired of me!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“As you were of me!” she blazed out, now
roused into speech. “Listen, since you dare
address me as you do. I did not love you.
You thought I did. I thought I did. When
you found it convenient for some reason, I
neither know nor care what, to leave me without
a word, I found, for the first time, that I
was only in love with <em>being</em> in love. No,—wait
until I am through. Ten years ago I became
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>engaged to the bravest and best and truest man
that ever lived.” Marion’s voice broke, but she
went on. “He died and I kept on loving his
memory, loving him wherever he might be.
When I met you, the striking resemblance you
bore to him smote me like an electric shock.
You seemed good and noble like him, and
under the glamour of your constant presence
and evident fancy for me, I allowed myself to
drift into a sentimental feeling for you. I now
see what that feeling was. It was only a love
of being in love; and you happened to be the
one man I have met so far, and I hope the
only one I shall ever meet, capable of calling
that feeling out. You have compelled me to
speak plainly. I hope you are satisfied. This
is our gate. Miss Shepard has retired, but she
will be glad to see you at the office in the
morning. Good-night.” And Marion left
him standing rooted to the ground where she
left him.</p>

<p class='c008'>For a few days Burnham felt himself a badly
used man. He had loved and his love had
been trampled on, he said to himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>He went back to Lowell the next day, promising
to write Villard; and a week after, when he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>had settled down at home again with his dainty
and querulous mother, he went calmly over the
ground of his defeat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She never did a more sensible thing in her
life,” he declared, as he lighted his pipe, at
last. “It would have been an awful bore to
have to live up to her ideal.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>XIX.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Three days passed at the mills with no
special incident. To Salome they seemed the
dullest she had ever known. For the first time,
she discovered that the Shawsheen Mills and
the condition of its operatives was not enough
to satisfy the inmost longings of her heart, or
to still its disquietude. Without the presence
of John Villard, and the constant inspiration
of his presence, life lost its zest and sparkle.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the three days were over, Salome went
to her pillow at night with a sense of relief.
Until now, she had not realized what her position
at the head of the mills might mean without
Villard. She saw that without him she
could have done little, and would have made
many mistakes—a fact which it was good for
her to realize. And then she remembered,
with sudden terror, that he might leave her at
any moment, as Burnham had done.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>“He will be home in the morning,” she said
to her disquieted heart, “and I will offer him
a share in the business. I will make him a
partner, and then I shall never lose him.”
And even in the darkness of night and the
privacy of her own room, she resolutely put
away from herself any other contingency.</p>

<p class='c008'>The morning dawned beautiful, fresh and
balmy, as only a spring morning late in May
can dawn in New England. Salome dressed
herself with unusual care. A strange, happy
feeling under-ran all her thoughts. She would
not think of him; she would not look forward
to his coming; but, for her, all the gladness of
the May morning, all the blossoming of spring
flowers, all the caroling of joyous birds, meant
only that Villard had arrived in Shepardtown
on the night express, and that she would see him
in an hour or two. She did not hurry her
preparations for breakfast,—this was such a
strange, delightful mood. She looked at her
own reflection in the mirror, thinking unconsciously
of making herself fair for him. She
sang snatches of merry song from the last
comic opera, laughing to herself as she recalled
how her nurse used to forbid her singing before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>the morning meal, and how she used to repeat,
in a lugubrious tone, the old sign:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“If you sing before breakfast,</div>
      <div class='line'>You’ll cry before night.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>And, still singing, she stopped at her aunt’s
room, only to find that everybody had gone
downstairs before her.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Soule and Marion were chatting pleasantly
over their hot-house grapes when she
entered the breakfast-room. The morning
papers lay untouched beside Salome’s plate.
She took her place and leisurely pared an
orange. Afterwards she remembered the time
she wasted in cutting the peel into fantastic
shapes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Has nobody looked at the papers?” she
asked, after a while. “I declare, how self-absorbed
we are growing. Who knows but
the world has, half of it, come to an end, over
night?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She picked up one of the papers—the one
which contained the most startling head-lines,
the most sickening sensations. Opening it, her
eyes became riveted to the front page. Her
face paled. She grew whiter, but no one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>noticed. When Marion looked up, the paper was
falling from Salome’s hand, and she had fallen
back in her chair—faint, speechless with terror.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a cry, Marion sprang to her side; but
Salome, by a tremendous effort, recovered herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Read it,” she gasped, “and tell me what
to do.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Marion picked up the paper, and read:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>HORRIBLE ACCIDENT ON THE ALBANY ROAD.</div>
    <div class='c003'><span class='sc'>Thirteen Killed and Twenty Wounded.</span></div>
    <div class='c003'><span class='sc'>Terrible Slaughter due to Carelessness.</span></div>
    <div class='c003'><span class='sc'>Prominent Business Men of Boston and Shepardtown among the Injured.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Running her eye hastily down the column,
Marion gathered that the night express had
been crashed into by a heavy freight; that
both trains had been thrown off the track;
that many passengers had been killed, scalded,
mangled or bruised.</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked quickly over the list of killed.
There were no familiar names; but at the head
of the wounded was:</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>“John Villard of Shepardtown. Fatally
injured. Impossible to recover.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She turned to Salome, who was already leaving
the table.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Help me to get ready,” she said. “I must
go to him immediately.” Marion marveled to
see her so calm; but she knew only too well the
anguish concealed in the woman’s heart below.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is it? What are you going to do?
Why does not some one tell me?” asked Mrs.
Soule.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dear auntie,” and Salome bent and kissed
the fair, soft cheek, “there has been a terrible
accident to the train that Mr. Villard was
coming home on. I am going to him. He is
dying.” Then she left the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>In less than an hour she was at the railway
station, waiting for the train to Boston. At
the last moment, Mrs. Soule, having recovered
from the shock which the news had given her,
had tried to dissuade her niece from going.</p>

<p class='c008'>It seemed to her that this was the strangest
thing her unaccountable niece had ever done.
She really must remonstrate with her on the
impropriety of her conduct. And seeing that
Salome would not be restrained from making
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>this erratic trip, she proposed to go, too, as
chaperon. Only Salome must wait for the
noon train, as she could not possibly get ready
for an earlier one.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The noon train!” exclaimed Salome, buttoning
her gloves. “No, auntie, Mr. Villard
may not live until then. I shall go to him at
once. You forget that I am no longer a young
girl. I am a business woman, and my chief
assistant lies dying.” She bent over and kissed
her aunt, who was still remonstrating, and ran
down the steps to the waiting carriage, where
Marion had already taken her seat.</p>

<p class='c008'>Marion, too, had offered to go with her; but
Salome had only replied:</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, dear. If you will take my place here,
that is all I ask.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And when the train finally drew out of
Shepardtown, and she had left her friend standing
on the platform, she gave an involuntary
sigh. Only the strong heart, which can best
bear its grief alone, will understand her feeling.</p>

<p class='c008'>The train had never seemed so slow to her.
Strained and anxious with that nervous intensity
which makes a woman waste her strength
in a half-conscious physical effort to propel, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>her own will-power, the great, unsympathetic,
methodical engine, she sat straight up in her
seat with heart and soul benumbed. Constantly
before her, was the picture of John Villard—mangled,
bleeding, dying—perhaps dead.
Her brain reeled as she thought of him lying
pale and cold in death.</p>

<p class='c008'>She remembered how, only three days ago,
he had clasped her hand and looked into her
eyes; how he had called her “Salome,” his
voice deep and tender with emotion. Dead?
No, it could not be. And still the long, unfeeling
train stopped to take on its horde of
passengers, or to let off a working-man or a
school-girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>The hour’s ride to Boston seemed to her an
eternity; and when, at last, they rolled into the
long, covered shed, Salome was first to reach
the steps, and first to touch the platform.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ordering a carriage, she was soon on her way
across the city. But here again the slowness
of her progress drove her nearly frantic. She
called to the driver and told him she would
double his fee if he caught the next train for
the scene of the accident. He did not know
what time that would be, but he accepted the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>offer and drove at such a rate of speed that an
agent of the Humane Society ran after him to
catch his number,—and did not succeed.</p>

<p class='c008'>When they reached the Albany station,
Salome threw him the smallest bill she had, a
two-dollar one,—and without waiting for the
change, hastened to the ticket-office. It was
beset with more than the usual crowd of curious
questioners and eager passengers, whose plans
the accident had thrown into confusion. It
was some minutes before Salome could reach
the window. She was about to turn away in
despair when the agent recognized her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let that lady pass, there,” he said, authoritatively;
and then Salome learned that a
relief train had been sent early in the morning,
that another would be starting in ten minutes,
and that regular trains would be run in the
course of an hour or two, “carrying by,” at
Jones’s Crossing, where the accident had
occurred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And the injured ones, are they still——”
her voice failed her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They are still living,” answered the agent.
“But some of them are so badly hurt they
must die. Stand back there, one minute,” he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>said to the crowd. “Well, I don’t know, miss,
whether you could go on the relief train. You
might go out and ask, though they’ve shut
down on the crowd.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Salome turned away. For the first time since
breakfast a clear thought came into her brain.
She went out to the train-gate.</p>

<p class='c008'>No, they could not take any one. There
were so many wanting to go, and they only
took one car. Oh, a friend of the injured?
Well, she must go to the division superintendent,
or the general passenger agent. There
was the “G. P. A.” over there.</p>

<p class='c008'>Salome walked over to the official designated,—a
pleasant gentleman with kind eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am Miss Shepard of Shepardtown,” she
said; “my chief superintendent is among the injured,
and is probably dying. He has no friends,
and I must get to him. Can you help me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The official took out a little book, wrote her
name on a blank pass, and handed it to her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anything we can do for him or for you,
Miss Shepard, we shall be glad to do. You
needn’t hesitate to ask. Your grandfather
was once kind to me, when I was a poor boy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The passenger agent hurried away to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>engine, giving some last orders, and Salome
did not have a chance to thank him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ll have to hurry, miss,” a brakeman said
who was standing near. “The train is going.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A moment later she was on the way for
Jones’s Crossing.</p>

<p class='c008'>This train had the right of way and a clear
track for some distance. They seemed to fly,
as they sped out through the suburbs into the
country beyond.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bloom of the May morning was still on
the tender, up-springing grass and the fresh
foliage of the trees. Birds sang cheerfully on,
in spite of the thundering engine on its way to
the scene of woe. But there was no more
beauty in the world for Salome.</p>

<p class='c008'>Three or four physicians sat in the corner
of the one baggage-car which they all occupied
together, and, used as they were to scenes of
death and suffering, talked indifferently of
politics and the misdoings of Congress. The
brakeman laughed as the conductor passed
him with some trivial remark. To Salome it
seemed that she alone, of all the world, cared
because thirteen persons lay dead and twenty
more were fatally injured, a few miles away.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>Afterwards, when she saw the tenderness
and courageous sympathy of these people
among the suffering, she reversed her judgment.</p>

<p class='c008'>A small woman in black sat at the opposite
end of the car, and was the only other passenger.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who is that?” She stopped the conductor
to ask the question, at last drawn out of her
own sorrow by the pathetic attitude of the
woman’s figure.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s the engineer’s mother. He is
fatally hurt. He’s the last of her five boys,
and her sole dependence. It’s pretty rough on
her; but the boys won’t let her suffer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His words came like a reproach to her.
What right had she, with all her wealth and
friends and pleasures, to think of herself as the
only suffering one? What was her sorrow,
compared to that of this bereaved mother?</p>

<p class='c008'>She felt an impulse to go over to the motionless
figure and speak a word of comfort. And
then she felt the train slacking up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’re almost there,” the conductor said,
as he passed her again.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the train stopped, two of the physicians,
having heard who she was, came forward with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>offers of assistance. The others were kindly
aiding the pathetic old lady in black.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then Salome found herself face to face
with such a scene as she had never even dreamed
of.</p>

<p class='c008'>The public is, through the “enterprising”
journalistic system of the present day, already
too familiar with such scenes of sickening horror.
To Salome, this one came as the vivid realization
of things she had hitherto carefully avoided
in the newspapers.</p>

<p class='c008'>At first, she turned faint and sick at the
prospect. Several dead bodies lay plainly in
sight, partially covered with a blanket. The
living must first be cared for; and groans on
every side, from those who, even yet, had
not been extricated from the debris, told how
much still remained to be done.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tell me,” she said, catching at the arm of a
doctor who had been on the ground since daybreak,
“where is Mr. Villard?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Villard? Let’s see—tall man? Dark
hair and full beard? Yes. He was removed
to the tavern over there an hour ago.” And
he passed on to another sufferer.</p>

<p class='c008'>Salome looked across the railroad track, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>the direction the physician had pointed. There
was a country store, a “tavern,” and three or
four less pretentious buildings.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hastily she clambered over the torn-up track,
down the embankment and across the narrow,
open field. There were no signs of life around
the group of houses. Everybody was at the
scene of the accident.</p>

<p class='c008'>She walked into the tavern. It seemed to be
deserted. Through the narrow hall she could
see, at the end of the building, a dining-room;
at one side was the office, where no one was in
view. The clerk heard her step, however, and
came hastily from the dining-room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is there a Mr. Villard here?” she began—“a
patient, from the accident?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There are three men upstairs who were
hurt,” the clerk answered. “There’s no one
here to tend office, or I’d show you up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I must find him. Is there no one to show
me the way?” she asked, impatient at this
last trivial delay.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They’re each in different rooms up there,”
was the reply. “Walk right up the stairs.
There’s nurses up there. They’ll tell you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Salome turned up the narrow, dingy staircase.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>At the top there was no one in sight.
Groans came from behind a closed door. Inside,
she could hear voices, subdued to an
undertone. In the absolute silence, she heard
the word “amputation.” Could this be Villard’s
room?</p>

<p class='c008'>She leaned against the wall, unable to try
that latch. While she stood there, helpless and
dazed, she lifted her eyes to the opposite doorway.
It was open.</p>

<p class='c008'>Inside, there seemed to be no one. Certainly
there was no attendant. She stepped forward
and looked in. There, on the white, clean bed,
lay the form of John Villard, his face whiter
than the pillow it rested against, his dark hair
contrasting strangely with his paleness.</p>

<p class='c008'>With the sight, all the repressed love of the
last two years swept over Salome like a resistless
impulse. A hand seemed clutching at her
heart. Her limbs seemed paralyzed; but in an
instant she was beside the bed, looking down
at the closed eyes. A terrible fear that he was
dead swept over her. With an inarticulate
groan, she knelt beside him and laid her hand
against his face.</p>

<p class='c008'>He opened his eyes and smiled faintly. He
thought he had died and reached Heaven.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>XX.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Villard’s convalescence was slow and tedious.
When Salome had found him, his dislocated
shoulder had been restored to place, and his
broken ankle set. Then, as there were not
nurses enough for the great need, he had been
left alone.</p>

<p class='c008'>What passed in that first ten minutes after
Salome had found him is still a sacred
memory between them. At last, she said, looking
at him through wet eyes, “You must have
a nurse.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Salome, do not leave me,” he answered;
and his voice, weakened from his
injuries and tender with the passion which, at
last, he had not been afraid to declare, was
like music to her heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>She bent her blushing face upon the pillow
beside him. “May I stay and take care of
you?” she asked, softly.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>“May you? Oh, Salome!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Another silence fell between them. Both
hearts were too full for words.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then we must be married to-day.” Salome
had waited a little for him to say it; but, manlike,
he had not been thinking of the proprieties.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I cannot leave you to hired nurses now,”
she murmured. “So, there is only this one
way out of it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And a blessed way it is.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And so they were married, that bright
May morning, amid scenes of anguish, and
while Villard still hovered near the gates of
death. And for weeks they remained at
“Jones’s Tavern,” he ill, wretched, racked with
pain; she, bearing the trials and discomforts of
the place, vigils of long night-watches, the dull,
dragging anxiety; and yet, there was never a
happier or more blessed honeymoon.</p>

<p class='c008'>When he was able to be moved on a
stretcher, he was taken to Shepardtown. Their
home-coming was a glad one, although it was
necessarily quiet. Every operative in the mills
had been at the station, when the train that
bore the two who had done so much for them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>came steaming in. Salome nodded to many of
them, with moist but happy eyes. But the
family physician, who had met them in Boston,
would allow of no hand-shaking.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Time enough for that by and by,” he
told the men who stood foremost in the crowd.
“Do you want to kill him?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He could not prevent several of the strongest
ones from stepping forward, however, and
taking the stretcher in their own hands, and bearing
Villard very gently to the waiting carriage.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I never thought to enter this house so,”
Villard whispered to Salome, when he was
carefully borne up the stairs in the Shepard
mansion and placed tenderly in bed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank Heaven, you were permitted to
come, even <em>so</em>,” she replied, with a shudder.
He had been so near Death’s door, instead!</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t and won’t say I approve of what
you’ve done,” said Mrs. Soule that night. “If
you must marry him at all, I could not see why
you should want to do it then and there. You
might have waited, I think, and had such a
wedding as befits a daughter of the Bourdillons.
Besides, all this watching and care has
pulled you down. You look pale and worn.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>You’ll lose your beauty before you are thirty-five.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Salome did not answer. These matters
seemed so trivial.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose, at least, you’ll give a reception
when he gets well enough. You really owe it
to society and your own position. All your
father’s, your mother’s, and your own friends
will expect it. You have planned for that, I
suppose? Since you had no wedding gown, you
ought to give Redfern <i><span lang="fr">carte blanche</span></i> for your
reception gown. Have you written them?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Auntie,” said Salome, “John and I have
been, in these past weeks, where we did not
think of party gowns.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, I suppose there was not much at
Jones’s Crossing to remind you of them. But
now, you certainly are thinking of one <em>now</em>?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Salome sighed. There was really no use in
expecting her little, exquisite, cameo-cut aunt
to understand her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose we may give some sort of reception.
All my people are waiting anxiously to
see John,” she said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Factory-people!” exclaimed Mrs. Soule
indignantly; but her niece had moved away.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>It was several weeks later, when Villard was
first able to come downstairs. As soon as
possible for him to bear the excitement, the
operatives were invited to the house one evening,
and permitted to shake hands with the man
whom they had always considered their friend,
and to whom they had now become closely endeared.
The marriage between him and
Salome had, somehow, seemed to draw him
closer to them. They were now his people as
well as hers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This isn’t going to take you away from us
at the Hall?” said one of the young men during
the evening. “Mr. Fales and Mr. Welman
are good—but they are not you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shall be there every evening,” was Villard’s
reply. “I am much more anxious not
to lose you than you can be not to lose me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know about that,” the younger one
said.</p>

<p class='c008'>When they had all gone away, and Marion
had sent them both upstairs for the night,
Salome drew her husband down to her favorite
seat in a cosy bay-window, where the August
moon was streaming in through vines and foliage,
making a checkered radiance around them.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>“John,” she began, “I have a plan to tell
you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is it, dear?” he asked, drawing her
head to his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am going to retire from active business.”
She laughed softly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What <em>can</em> you mean?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can’t you see? I’m going to retire. You
are now the head of the Shawsheen Mills.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Villard said nothing. In spite of the great
love between them, he could not forget that
she was wealthy nor that he was poor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have to-day made over the entire mill property
to you,” she went on. “I am not
going to have it said that your wife has all the
money and all the power, and that you are
only her dependent.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Salome! you dear, generous heart,” said
Villard brokenly; “I cannot accept.” He
felt that she had divined his sensitiveness,
although she had been too delicate to speak of
it. “I am poor, but I am not a beggar.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And I, too, am proud,” she replied, laying
her hand on his cheek. “I will not have
people saying that you are tied to a rich wife
and are subject to her whims. Oh, I know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>how they talk; I have seen and heard them
all my life! Why, they would say you were
a fortune-hunter.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You do not think so?” he asked, gently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Confess, dear,” she answered him. “If it
had not been for that, wouldn’t you have
spoken long ago?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Villard pressed her closer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I came very near it, as it was,” he said,
presently. “But I could not bear to be
thought that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I had the necessary papers made out this
afternoon,” she said after an eloquent silence,
“when I was out. So you see the thing is
done whether you will or not. You need have
no hesitation. I still have a large fortune left,
you know, from the Bourdillons.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If it were anybody else in the world but
my noble, generous wife,” he began, “I would
refuse, even now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If it were any one else but my noble
husband,” she replied, “I could not yield
control of the mills, and all the plans I have
cherished for the employes. But I know in
whom I trust,” and her eyes shone with wifely
pride and affection.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>“There are still so many things to do,” said
Villard, a little later. “I know I can always
depend on you to help me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I am not laying down the work and
retiring to the old life of idleness,” was the
reply. “I shall leave the management of the
mills to their new owner. It’s no part of a
married woman’s business to manage her husband’s
office. But I shall have all the more
leisure left for doing good. I have no end of
schemes to lay before you; and, I have no
doubt, you have wiser plans than mine.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am glad, on the whole,” said Villard
thoughtfully, “that you are going to have more
freedom. You are tired and worn with watching
and caring for me,—dear, blessed soul that
you are. Your burdens, in the past two years,
have been borne marvelously well. Any other
woman would have given way long ago. But,
after all, I am a selfish man.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You, John!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes. I must confess, I want you all to
myself, a part of the time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All I have and all I am, dear, is yours.
And yet, I cannot help feeling that we have
still a great work to do. Employers, on all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>sides, are looking to see us fail in our attempts.
As we stand or fall, will factories outside of
Shepardtown be benefited or injured.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I remember what you once said, Salome.
Your brave words were a watchword with me
many a time when my courage was low.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What were they?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘We want to show the world that the
spirit of Him crucified may rule in a cotton-mill
as fully as in the life of a saint.’ My darling,
nobody but you would have had the courage
to say that. We will take the sentiment as our
rule of life.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And act on Rossetti’s beautiful words,”
added Salome:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And though age wearies by the way,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And hearts break in the furrow,</div>
      <div class='line'>We’ll sow the golden grain to-day,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The harvest reap to-morrow!</div>
      <div class='line'>Build up heroic lives, and all</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Be like the sheathen saber,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Oh, Chivalry of Labor!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>And then they sat silent in the checkered
moonlight.</p>
